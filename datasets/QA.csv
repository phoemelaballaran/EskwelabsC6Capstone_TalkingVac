What is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, Peoples Republic of China.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, fatigue. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include loss of taste or smell, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis (also known as red eyes), sore throat, headache, muscle or joint pain, different types of skin rash, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, chills or dizziness. Symptoms of severe COVID-19 disease include shortness of breath, loss of appetite, confusion, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, and high temperature (above 38 Â°C). Other less common symptoms are irritability, confusion, reduced consciousness (sometimes associated with seizures), anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, more severe and rare neurological complications such as strokes, brain inflammation, delirium and nerve damage. People of all ages who experience fever and/or cough associated with difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical care immediately. If possible, call your health care provider hotline or health facility first, so you can be directed to the right clinic.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What happens to people who get COVID-19?,"Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care. Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys. In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Who is most at risk of severe illness from COVID-19?,"People aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, obesity or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness. However, anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?,"Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms. WHO is working with our Global Technical Network for Clinical Management of COVID-19, researchers and patient groups around the world to design and carry out studies of patients beyond the initial acute course of illness to understand the proportion of patients who have long term effects, how long they persist, and why they occur. These studies will be used to develop further guidance for patient care.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?,"Stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds and close contact, regularly cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
When should I get a test for COVID-19?,"Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, infected may also consider testing. Contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance. While a person is waiting for test results, they should remain isolated from others. Where testing capacity is limited, tests should first be done for those at higher risk of infection, such as health workers, and those at higher risk of severe illness such as older people, especially those living in seniors residences or long-term care facilities.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What test should I get to see if I have COVID-19?,"In most situations, a molecular test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and confirm infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most commonly used molecular test. Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. Molecular tests detect virus in the sample by amplifying viral genetic material to detectable levels. For this reason, a molecular test is used to confirm an active infection, usually within a few days of exposure and around the time that symptoms may begin.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What about rapid tests?,"Rapid antigen tests (sometimes known as a rapid diagnostic test RDT) detect viral proteins (known as antigens). Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. These tests are cheaper than PCR and will offer results more quickly, although they are generally less accurate. These tests perform best when there is more virus circulating in the community and when sampled from an individual during the time they are most infectious.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"I want to find out if I had COVID-19 in the past, what test could I take?","Antibody tests can tell us whether someone has had an infection in the past, even if they have not had symptoms. Also known as serological tests and usually done on a blood sample, these tests detect antibodies produced in response to an infection. In most people, antibodies start to develop after days to weeks and can indicate if a person has had past infection. Antibody tests cannot be used to diagnose COVID-19 in the early stages of infection or disease but can indicate whether or not someone has had the disease in the past.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is the difference between isolation and quarantine?,"Both isolation and quarantine are methods of preventing the spread of COVID-19. Quarantine is used for anyone who is a contact of someone infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, whether the infected person has symptoms or not. Quarantine means that you remain separated from others because you have been exposed to the virus and you may be infected and can take place in a designated facility or at home. For COVID-19, this means staying in the facility or at home for 14 days. Isolation is used for people with COVID-19 symptoms or who have tested positive for the virus. Being in isolation means being separated from other people, ideally in a medically facility where you can receive clinical care. If isolation in a medical facility is not possible and you are not in a high risk group of developing severe disease, isolation can take place at home. If you have symptoms, you should remain in isolation for at least 10 days plus an additional 3 days without symptoms. If you are infected and do not develop symptoms, you should remain in isolation for 10 days from the time you test positive.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What should I do if I have been exposed to someone who has COVID-19?,"If you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you may become infected, even if you feel well. After exposure to someone who has COVID-19, do the following: Call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline to find out where and when to get a test. Cooperate with contact-tracing procedures to stop the spread of the virus. If testing is not available, stay home and away from others for 14 days. While you are in quarantine, do not go to work, to school or to public places. Ask someone to bring you supplies. Keep at least a 1-metre distance from others, even from your family members. Wear a medical mask to protect others, including if/when you need to seek medical care. Clean your hands frequently. Stay in a separate room from other family members, and if not possible, wear a medical mask. Keep the room well-ventilated. If you share a room, place beds at least 1 metre apart. Monitor yourself for any symptoms for 14 days. Stay positive by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising at home. If you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever, seek medical help if you have a fever. While travelling to and from the health facility and during medical care, wear a mask, keep at least a 1-metre distance from other people and avoid touching surfaces with your hands. This applies to adults and children.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How long does it take to develop symptoms?,"The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days. This is why people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away from others, for 14 days, in order to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?,"If you have any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for instructions and find out when and where to get a test, stay at home for 14 days away from others and monitor your health. If you have shortness of breath or pain or pressure in the chest, seek medical attention at a health facility immediately. Call your health care provider or hotline in advance for direction to the right health facility. If you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever, seek medical care if you have a fever.If local guidance recommends visiting a medical centre for testing, assessment or isolation, wear a medical mask while travelling to and from the facility and during medical care.Also keep at least a 1-metre distance from other people and avoid touching surfaces with your hands. This applies to adults and children.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Are there treatments for COVID-19?,"Scientists around the world are working to find and develop treatments for COVID-19. Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are at risk for severe disease and more advanced respiratory support such as ventilation for patients who are critically ill. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce the length of time on a ventilator and save lives of patients with severe and critical illness. Results from the WHOs Solidarity Trial indicated that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon regimens appear to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients. Hydroxychloroquine has not been shown to offer any benefit for treatment of COVID-19. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. ",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?,"Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19.In hospitals, physicians will sometimes use antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections which can be a complication of COVID-19 in severely ill patients. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can adolescents catch COVID-19?,"Yes. All age groups can catch COVID-19.While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, so far, data suggests that children under the age of 18 years have few deaths compared to other age groups and usually mild disease. However, cases of critical illness have been reported. As with adults, pre-existing medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, asthma, diabetes, obesity, cancer and neurological and developmental conditions are risk factors for severe disease and intensive care admission in children.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can adolescents spread COVID-19 to other people even if they have mild or no symptoms?,"Yes. Infected people in all age groups including adolescents - can transmit the virus to other people, even if they have mild symptoms or do not feel ill. The virus is spread from person to person through liquid particles such as aerosols (smaller) and droplets (larger) from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from an adolescent infected with the virus. Therefore, it is important to stay at least 1 meter away from others. These droplets can land on objects and surfaces. People can then become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"Since there are few known cases of adolescents getting seriously ill with COVID-19, should I go to a health facility if I develop symptoms of the disease?","If you have any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, contact your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for instructions and find out what to do. If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, and no risk factors for severe disease there is generally no need to go to a health care facility. Your health provider will assess the situation and give instructions when and where to get a test, stay at home for 14 days away from others and monitor your health. Seek medical care immediately if your health gets worse, or if there is no one in your family that can take care of you at home. If possible, call your health care provider, hotline or health facility first, so you can be directed to the right clinic. It is important that you follow the procedures put in place by your country. Ask a family member or another trusted adult how you can find out what these procedures are where you live.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What should I do if someone in my family gets really ill with COVID-19?,"Immediately seek medical care if a member of your family gets seriously ill, for example develops difficulty breathing or feels pain or pressure in the chest. If possible, either you or an adult should contact your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for instructions and find out where and how you could get care. If your family member is confirmed as having COVID-19, you must be prepared that you and other known contacts will need to isolate for 14 days and monitor symptoms, even if you feel healthy.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"I was due to get vaccinated for HPV, meningitis or tetanus, but immunization services have been disrupted. Should I be concerned?","WHO recommends that countries continue routine immunization services wherever feasible. For example, school-based vaccination initiatives should continue only if infection prevention and control measures are implemented to avoid increased risk of transmission of the COVID-19 virus among the students, school personnel and health care providers. However, vaccines provided to adolescents have sufficiently flexible schedules to make sure you can get the vaccine in time when vaccination services start again. For example, the HPV vaccine that requires two doses can be started any time between 9 and 14 years of age and the interval between the two doses can be longer. The minimum interval between doses is 6 months, but it can be 12 or 15 months and, if necessary, even longer. It is most important that you receive the second dose at some point in time to be fully protected.Decisions to continue routine vaccination services are made by each country. Ask a family member or another trusted adult how you can get information about vaccination services where you live. It is important you get the vaccines you are supposed to get, even if they have to be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
I am on medication for a chronic health condition. Should I change anything?,"For people with chronic conditions such as such as asthma, diabetes, TB and HIV the most important thing is to continue your medication as prescribed, attend recommended check-ups and seek medical help if you have new symptoms. Check with your health authorities and health provider if your regular check-ups should be done differently during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some services, such as counselling, may be available remotely. For treatment of clinically stable adolescents with HIV and adolescents with TB and/or other chronic conditions, your health provider should consider multi-month prescriptions and dispensing which will reduce the frequency of your visits to the clinic and ensure continuity of treatment, if movements are disrupted during the pandemic. Seek advice from your health authorities and health care provider on how to be protected from COVID-19 and continue your treatment as prescribed.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"I know there is a risk of getting COVID-19, but can I still play sports?","Yes. You can play sports that are in line with the physical distancing measures and movement restrictions that are in place in your country. If you are able to go for a bicycle ride, or if you go to a park or public open space to walk, run or exercise always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home. If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. Being physically active is good for your health, both physical and mental. Set up a regular routine to practice activities or sports that do not require close contact with others every day for 1 hour. You can do individual sports, like jogging, walking, dancing or yoga. There are many options to try. You can set up playground games indoors, such as jump rope and hop-scotch, play with your brothers and sisters, and practice some strength training activities, using improvised weights like bottles full of water or sand. If you have access to the internet, you can also join in online active games or fitness classes, or set up your own online physical exercises with your friends or classmates. Find an activity that is fun, can be done within the restrictions that are in place in your country, and makes you feel good.Do not exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing.Stay home and rest, seek medical attention and follow the directions of your local health authority.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Schools are reopening in some areas of my country. Is it safe to go back to school?,"A decision to reopen schools in every country and area is made based on careful assessment of the situation, with consensus among all the key parties involved, including the health and education policy-makers, teachers and other school staff, parents and health and community workers. In addition, reopening of schools is carefully planned and prepared, with all necessary measures in place to protect the safety and health of everyone in the school community. Therefore, if your school reopens, you should feel assured it is safe for you to go back to school provided that you strictly follow the guidelines and rules that will be provided by your school.Of course, if you have any concerns with going back to school, do not hesitate to speak out to your teachers and parents or guardians.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What should I do if I missed out on my education due to the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Your school or place where you are studying are likely to make arrangements for you to catch up on what you have missed when your school was closed. Many schools have put in place accelerated learning modalities to help pupils catch up on learning loss. If your school is still closed, and you cannot attend classes in person, follow the procedures that your school has put in place to give you access to educational materials and technologies (internet, texting radio, radio, or television). If you have access to the internet, you can also consult your teachers and other trusted adults to identify and access reliable online learning opportunities and resources, including those included in thedistance learning solutions recommended by UNESCO, the United Nations agency that helps countries improve their education systems. In addition, UNESCO is collectingstories from students, teachers and parentsabout how they are coping and continuing to learn during school closures. Access those stories, they might inspire you. You can also contact UNESCO and share your story! Find out how to share it here.In places where internet connectivity is a problem, many governments have started to broadcast educational programmes on TV and radio channels during school closures. If you live in such a place, look out for educational programmes on your local TV and radio channels.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should I wear a mask at school or when playing sports?,"You should not wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing on the playground, so that it doesn't compromise your breathing. However, remember to maintain at least a 1-metre distance from others, limit the number of friends playing together, and respect hand hygiene.Regarding wearing masks in schools and other public places, WHO advises that people always consult and abide by local authorities on recommended practices in their area. In countries or areas where there is intense community transmission of the virus and in settings where physical distancing cannot be achieved, WHO and UNICEF advise decision makers to apply the following criteria for use of masks in schools (either in classes, corridors or communal areas) when developing national policies: Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. For children between six and 11 years of age, the decision to use a mask will vary from place to place, and will depend on several factors, such as the intensity of transmission in the area where the child lives, local norms that influence social interactions, the childs capacity to comply with the appropriate use of masks and availability of appropriate adult supervision, and other factors. Children and adolescents 12 years or older should follow the national mask guidelines for adults.Watch our How to wear a fabric mask video for a demonstration.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
When will this pandemic end so things can go back to normal?,"We don't know when the pandemic will end, but we know it depends on every persons contribution in helping stop the spread of the virus. The sacrifices you have made by not seeing your friends and by not going to school for a while, and other activities, are your contributions to fighting the pandemic. By putting societies and economies on hold, we have reduced the ability of the virus to spread through our communities. These defensive measures have helped to limit the damage the virus can cause, and bought us time to learn more about the virus and find solutions so that we can get back to a more familiar way of living. This is why it was possible to reopen schools and businesses in many places. It is important that you continue to practice the recommended measures and encourage your friends to do the same to prevent the situation from getting worse.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What can we do so that other diseases like COVID-19 do not affect us in future?,"COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease which means that it existed naturally in animals before it spilled over to humans. Most new or emerging infectious diseases âwhether in wildlife, domestic animals, plants or people â are driven by human activities that lead to environmental degradation. Human pressures, from deforestation, to intensive and polluting agricultural practices, to unsafe management and consumption of wildlife, increase the risk of new or emerging infectious diseases. This is why the number of emerging infectious disease outbreaks has increased steadily since 1980. To prevent the disastrous effects of emerging infectious diseases, we have to recognize that human health is intimately connected to the health of animals and our shared environment, and take action. Millions of young people have already mobilized to demand action not only on climate and biodiversity - but also for the right to breathe clean air, and for their future on a liveable planet. You can join them to add your voice and talents to this global movement:Read and disseminate the WHO Manifesto for a healthy recovery from COVID-19 by disseminating it and taking personal steps Support actions in your country to implement the 6 prescriptions of the WHO Manifesto for a healthy recovery from COVID-19.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can COVID-19 be passed through breastfeeding?,Transmission of active COVID-19 (virus that can cause infection) through breast milk and breastfeeding has not been detected to date. There is no reason to avoid or stop breastfeeding.,World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"In communities where COVID-19 is prevalent, should mothers breastfeed?","Yes. In all socio-economic settings, breastfeeding improves survival and provides lifelong health and development advantages to newborns and infants. Breastfeeding also improves the health of mothers.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"Following delivery, should a baby still be immediately placed skin-to-skin and breastfed if the mother is confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19?","Yes. Immediate and continued skin-to-skin care, including kangaroo mother care, improves the temperature control of newborns and is associated with improved survival among newborn babies. Placing the newborn close to the mother also enables early initiation of breastfeeding which alsoreduces mortality.The numerous benefits of skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and illness associated with COVID-19.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 breastfeed?,"Yes. Women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can breastfeed if they wish to do so. They should: Wash hands frequently with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand rub and especially before touching the baby; Wear a medical mask during any contact with the baby, including while feeding; Sneeze or cough into a tissue. Then dispose of it immediately and wash hands again; Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces that mothers have touched. It is important to replace medical masks as soon as they become damp and dispose of them immediately. Masks should not be reused or touched in the front.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
If a mother confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 does not have a medical face mask should she still breastfeed?,"Yes. Breastfeeding unquestionably reduces mortality in newborns and infants and provides numerous lifelong health and brain development advantages to the child. Mothers with symptoms of COVID-19 are advised to wear a medical mask, but even if this is not possible, breastfeeding should be continued. Mothers should follow other infection prevention measures, such as washing hands, cleaning surfaces, sneezing or coughing into a tissue. Non-medical masks (e.g. home-made or cloth masks) have not been evaluated. At this time, it is not possible to make a recommendation for or against their use.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
I have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and am too unwell to breastfeed my baby directly. What can I do?,"If you are too unwell to breastfeed your baby due to COVID-19 or other complications, you should be supported to safely provide your baby with breast milk in a way possible, available, and acceptable to you. This could include:Expressing milk; Donor human milk. If expressing breast milk or donor human milk are not feasible then consider wet nursing (another woman breastfeeds the child) or infant formula milk with measures to ensure that it is feasible, correctly prepared, safe and sustainable.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"I had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and was unable to breastfeed, when can I start to breastfeed again?",You can start to breastfeed when you feel well enough to do so. There is no fixed time interval to wait after confirmed or suspected COVID-19. There is no evidence that breastfeeding changes the clinical course of COVID-19 in a mother. Health workers or breastfeeding counsellors should support you to relactate.,World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"I have confirmed or suspected COVID-19, is it safer to give my baby infant formula milk?","No. There are always risks associated with giving infant formula milk to newborns and infants in all settings. The risks associated with giving infant formula milk are increased whenever home and community conditions are compromised, such as reduced access to health services if a baby becomes unwell, reduced access to clean water and/oraccess to supplies of infant formula milk are difficult or not guaranteed, affordable and sustainable. The numerous benefits of breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and illness associated with the COVID-19 virus.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should children wear a mask?,"WHO advises that people always consult and abide by local authorities on recommended practices in their area. An international and multidisciplinary expert group brought together by WHO reviewed evidence on COVID-19 disease and transmission in children and the limited available evidence on the use of masks by children. Based on this and other factors such as childrens psychosocial needs and developmental milestones, WHO and UNICEF advise the following: Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. This is based on the safety and overall interest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance. WHO and UNICEF advise that the decision to use masks for children aged 6-11 should be based on the following factors:Whether there is widespread transmission in the area where the child residesThe ability of the child to safely and appropriately use a maskAccess to masks, as well as laundering and replacement of masks in certain settings (such as schools and childcare services) Adequate adult supervision and instructions to the child on how to put on, take off and safely wear masksPotential impact of wearing a mask on learning and psychosocial development, in consultation with teachers, parents/caregivers and/or medical providersSpecific settings and interactions the child has with other people who are at high risk of developing serious illness, such as the elderly and those with other underlying health conditions WHO and UNICEF advise that children aged 12 and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area.More on the types of masks, how to choose them, and how to wear them is available here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Are there situations where children aged 5 years and under may wear or be required to wear a mask?,"In general, children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. This advice is based on the safety and overall interest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance. There may be local requirements for children aged 5 years and under to wear masks, or specific needs in some settings, such as being physically close to someone who is ill. In these circumstances, if the child wears a mask, a parent or other guardian should be within direct line of sight to supervise the safe use of the mask.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should children with developmental disabilities wear masks?,"The use of masks for children of any age with developmental disorders, disabilities or other specific health conditions should not be mandatory and be assessed on a case by case basis by the childs parent, guardian, educator and/or medical provider. In any case, children with severe cognitive or respiratory impairments with difficulties tolerating a mask should not be required to wear masks.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should children who have health issues or a medical condition that compromises their immune system wear a mask?,Children with underlying health conditions such as cystic fibrosis or cancer should wear a medical mask in consultation with their medical providers. A medical mask provides protection to the person wearing the mask and prevents transmission to others. It is recommended for anyone who has underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk of serious illness.,World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What type of mask should children wear?,"Children who are in general good health can wear a non-medical or fabric mask. This provides source control, meaning it keeps the virus from being transmitted to others if they are infected and are not aware that they are infected. The adult who is providing the mask should ensure the fabric mask is the correct size and sufficiently covers the nose, mouth and chin of the child. Children with underlying health conditions such as cystic fibrosis, cancer or immunosuppression, should, in consultation with their medical providers, wear a medical mask. A medical mask controls spreading of the virus and protection to the wearer, and is recommended for anyone who is at higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How should children wear a mask?,"Children should follow the same principles as adults for wearing masks. This includes cleaning hands at least 20 seconds if using an alcohol-based hand rub, or at least 40 seconds if using soap and water, before putting on the mask. Make sure the mask is the right size to cover the nose, mouth and chin. Children should be taught how to wear the mask properly, including not touching the front of the mask and not pulling it under the chin or into their mouth. They should store the mask in a bag or container, and not share the mask with others. More information, including videos on how to put on, take off and care for a mask, can be found here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should a child wear a mask at home?,"Any child who has symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 should wear a medical mask, as long as they can tolerate it. The child should be isolated, and medical advice sought as soon as they start to feel unwell, even if symptoms are mild. Family members/caregivers who come within 1 metre of the sick child at home should also wear a mask. A household member who is sick or has tested positive with the virus that causes COVID-19 should be isolated from everyone else if possible. If the child comes within 1 metre of the sick person at home, the adult and child should wear a medical mask during that time.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should teachers or other adults working with children wear a mask?,"In areas where there is widespread transmission, all adults under the age of 60 and who are in general good health should wear fabric masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others. This is particularly important for adults working with children who may have close contact with children and one another. Adults aged 60 or over, or who have any underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung cancer, should wear a medical mask because of their higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19. More information, including videos on how to put on, take off and care for a mask, can be found here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should children wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities?,"Children should not wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing on the playground, so that it doesnt compromise their breathing. When organizing these activities for children, it is important to encourage all other critical public health measures: maintaining at least a 1-metre distance from others, limiting the number of children playing together, providing access to hand hygiene facilities and encouraging their use.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Are there alternatives to fabric masks such as face shields?,"In the context of COVID-19, some children may not be able to wear a mask due to disabilities or specific situations such as speech classes where the teacher needs to see their mouths. In these cases, face shields may be considered an alternative to masks, but they do not provide the equivalent protection in keeping the virus from being transmitted to others. If a decision is made to use a face shield, it should cover the entire face, wrap around the sides of the face and extend to below the chin. Caution should be taken while wearing one to avoid injuries that could break it and harm the eyes or face.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What areas should be prioritized for disinfection in non-health care settings?,"Disinfection practices are important to reduce the potential for COVID-19 virus contamination in non-healthcare settings, such as in the home, office, schools, gyms, publicly accessible buildings, faith-based community centres, markets, transportation and business settings or restaurants. High-touch surfaces in these non-health care settings should be identified for priority disinfection such as door and window handles, kitchen and food preparation areas, counter tops, bathroom surfaces, toilets and taps, touchscreen personal devices, personal computer keyboards, and work surfaces.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"Are gloves recommended for the community in public spaces to protect against COVID-19, for example when going to the grocery store supermarket?","No. The use of gloves by the public in public spaces is not a recommended or proven prevention measure. Wearing gloves in public spaces does not replace the need for hand hygiene, nor does it offer any additional measure of protection against the COVID-19 virus than hand hygiene. Gloves do not provide complete protection against hand contamination, as pathogens may gain access to the hands via small defects in gloves or by contamination of the hands during glove removal. People can also transfer pathogens from one surface to another by touching with gloved hands, or even transfer pathogens to the mouth, nose, or eyes if they touch their face with gloved hands.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"How should I clean food items from the grocery store, for example fruit, vegetables or packaged items?","There is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food packaging. Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply.The COVID-19 virus is generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of the COVID-19 virus associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 40-60 seconds. Regular food safety and handling guidance should be followed.See: https://www.who.int/activities/promoting-safe-food-handling. For food service businesses, please see the below guidance on COVID-19 and Food Safety: https://www.who.int/teams/risk-communication/food-and-agriculture-sectors.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Where can I find the latest information on COVID-19?,"For the latest information on COVID-19, check regularly on the WHOs coronavirus pages: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Do weather and climate determine where COVID-19 occurs?,"No. There is currently no conclusive evidence that either weather (short term variations in meteorological conditions) or climate (long-term averages) have a strong influence on transmission. The SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19 disease has been transmitted in all regions of the world, from cold and dry, to hot and humid climates. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be mainly transmitted directly from person-to-person through close contact, or through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. People may be infected by touching exposed surfaces, but this is not thought to be a major transmission route. While temperature and humidity may influence how long the virus survives outside of the human body, this effect is likely to be small compared to the degree of contact between people.Physical distancing and washing hands are therefore essential to breaking the chain of transmission, and are the most effective way to protect yourself, in all locations and all seasons of the year.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Will climate change make COVID-19 worse?,"There is no evidence of a direct connection between climate change and the emergence or transmission of COVID-19 disease. As the disease is now well established in the human population, efforts should focus on reducing transmission and treating patients.However, climate change may indirectly affect the COVID-19 response, as it undermines environmental determinants of health, and places additional stress on health systems. More generally, most emerging infectious diseases, and almost all recent pandemics, originate in wildlife, and there is evidence that increasing human pressure on the natural environment may drive disease emergence. Strengthening health systems, improved surveillance of infectious disease in wildlife, livestock and humans, and greater protection of biodiversity and the natural environment, should reduce the risks of future outbreaks of other new diseases.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Have measures to contain COVID-19 reduced air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases?,"Air pollution is a serious health risk. It kills approximately 7 million people every year and is responsible for one third of all deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease. Over 90% of the global population lives in places where the WHO outdoor air quality guideline levels are not met, and about two-thirds of this exposure is caused by burning of fossil fuels, which also drives climate change.Efforts to control COVID-19 transmission have reduced economic activity and led to temporary improvements in air quality in some areas. In contrast, as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that drive climate change persist for a long time in the atmosphere, temporary emissions reductions only have a limited effect on atmospheric concentrations. Carbon dioxide levels at observing stations around the world in the first months of 2020 have been higher than in 2019.Environmental improvements resulting from the COVID-19 response may be reversed by a rapid expansion of polluting economic activities once the measures have ended, unless there is a clear focus to promote equity, environmental health, around a just transition to a green economy. Any short-term environmental benefits as a result of COVID-19 come at an unacceptable human and economic cost, and are no substitute for planned and sustained action on air quality and climate.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is contact tracing?,"Contact tracing is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a disease to prevent onward transmission. These people are called contacts. Contact tracing for COVID-19 requires identifying people who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and following them daily for 14 days. The goal is to stop transmission of the virus by reducing the number of people who are circulating with the virus.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How does contact tracing work?,"Contact tracing is a process that includes several steps: Defining contacts: a contact is a person who has been exposed to someone else infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, from 2 days before to 14 days after the person started to show symptoms. Identifying contacts: this is done through an interview with the person infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 to find out who they have been in contact with.Informing contacts: each contact should be contacted by phone or in person to determine if they meet the definition and then be monitored. Each person confirmed as a contact should be informed about the goal of contact tracing, the process (including how their personal data will be protected) and who to contact with any concerns or questions. Additional essential information should be provided on how and when to quarantine, symptoms to look for, and what to do if the person becomes unwell. Managing and monitoring contacts daily: the contact person identified should be encouraged and supported to stay in quarantine, which means to separate from others in order to limit the possibility of exposing other people to infection should they become ill. During the quarantine period, daily monitoring should be implemented to monitor their health for any sign of illness. The monitoring ends 14 days after the person was last in contact with the person infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.Data processes and analysis: The information on each contact person is gathered in a database and updated daily monitoring on the persons health status. These processes vary from country to country. ",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Who is defined as a contact?,"A contact is defined as anyone who had direct contact or was within 1 metre for at least 15 minutes with a person infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, even if the person with the confirmed infection did not have symptoms. Contacts should remain in self-quarantine during the 14-day monitoring period to limit the possibility of exposing other people to infection should they become ill.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can contact tracing help in controlling spread of the virus?,"Yes, when systematically applied, contact tracing will break the chains of transmission, meaning that the virus transmission can be stopped. Contact tracing is thus an essential public health tool for controlling infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
When should contact tracing be implemented?,"Comprehensive contact tracing should be implemented as soon as cases or clusters are identified. During intense transmission, contact tracing may be difficult but should be carried out as much as possible, focusing on vulnerable and household contacts, healthcare workers and high-risk closed settings (e.g., dormitories, institutions, long-term care homes and other long-term facilities). When countries have passed a peak in transmission and the numbers of sick people are decreasing, particularly when stringent public health and social measures are being adjusted, it is critical to maintain rapid identification of sick people and contact tracing. This identification and investigation break new transmission chains.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What happens if you are a contact?,"If you are a possible contact, you should first be contacted by phone or in person by health authorities to determine if you meet the contact definition, which is anyone who has had direct contact or was within 1 metre for at least 15 minutes with a person infected with COVID-19. If you are confirmed as a contact, you will then be encouraged and supported to be in quarantine, which means to separate yourself from others, and to monitor your health for any signs of illness. The monitoring ends 14 days you were last into contact with the person infected with COVID-19.By participating in contact tracing, you are contributing to controlling spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in your area; vulnerable people will be protected, and more restrictive measures, such as general stay-at-home orders, might be avoided or minimized. This is an act of solidarity for your community.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Who is needed for successful contact tracing?,"Everyone is needed for successful contact tracing and contact tracing begins with engaged communities. It requires individuals to agree to daily monitoring, to be willing to report signs or symptoms of COVID-19 promptly, and be prepared to go into quarantine for at least 14 days, or into isolation if they become symptomatic. Transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 can only be stopped if we all play our role to protect our family, friends and community.Contact tracing is only possible with contact tracers trained in the basics of virus transmission, prevention and control measures, how to monitor signs and symptoms, as well as the ethics of public health surveillance and quarantine. Ideally, contact tracers are recruited from their own community, including local government, civil society and non-governmental organizations, university students and community volunteers.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What are the tools used for contact tracing?,"Contact tracing is carried out by people who are assigned and trained to carry out this essential activity to break the chains of transmission. Electronic tools and information technology are not essential for contact tracing but can help to make it more efficient and are useful if contact tracing needs to be done on a large scale. Many digital tools have been developed to assist with COVID-19 contact tracing and case identification. These should not be considered as single solutions for contact tracing, but rather as complementary tools and should be carefully identified and analysed for technical, cost, and ethical issues.The Go.Data software application, for example, has been designed to support contact tracing and surveillance in outbreaks such as Ebola virus disease. Other tools exist for self-reporting of symptoms by contacts, as well as proximity applications that track peoples movements to indicate potential exposures to and from other persons. More on contact tracing in the context of COVID-19: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Contact_Tracing-Tools_Annex-2020.1",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What should be considered for data protection?,"The ethics of public health information, data protection, and data privacy must be considered at all levels of contact tracing activities, in all training activities for contact tracing, and when using contact tracing tools. In particular:Safeguards must be in place to guarantee privacy and data protection in accordance with the legal frameworks of the countries where systems are implemented. Everyone involved in contact tracing must adhere to the ethical principles of handling personal information, to ensure responsible data management and respect for privacy throughout the process. How data will be handled, stored, and used needs to be communicated to those concerned in a clear and transparent manner. This is important for buy-in and engagement as well as to avoid misperceptions that could jeopardize the effectiveness of a contact tracing programme. Digital tools used for contact tracing should be assessed before use to ensure safeguarding data protection according to national regulations.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"Can I get sick with COVID-19 through contact with urine, faeces or sewage?","While fragments of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) have been detected in the urine or faeces of some patients, there have been no reports to date of transmission of COVID-19 through urine or faeces. It remains important to protect yourself with personal protective equipment whenever contact with bodily fluids may occur and to clean your hands frequentlyInfectious SARS-CoV-2 has also not been detected in wastewater, suggesting transmission through contact or contamination with sewage is highly unlikely.Guidance for water, sanitation, hygiene and waste management can be found here.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"Can I get sick with COVID-19 from swimming in the sea, rivers, lakes or swimming pools?","Available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 does not spread from water. Natural bodies of water and swimming pools do not appear to pose a risk for COVID-19 transmission even if polluted by faeces or wastewater. Pools are usually treated regularly to prevent contamination with a range of pathogens which could be present.However, crowded beaches or swimming pools do pose a risk of spreading COVID-19 through close contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. To reduce the risk of this transmission, clean hands frequently, stay at least 1 metre away from others in and out of the water, and wear a mask when this distancing is not possible.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can I get sick with COVID-19 from drinking water?,"The risk coronaviruses pose to drinking water is considered to be low and SARS-CoV-2 virus has not been detected in drinking water supplies.Drinking water treatment methods neutralize infectious pathogens present in the water. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, which means it has a fragile fatty envelope that is easily destroyed by the treatment process. Therefore, treated drinking water does not pose a risk for COVID-19.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How can food businesses remain safe from virus contamination?,"The main priority is to keep the virus out of the food environment. Several key measures are required including upgrading of cleaning and sanitation measures, disinfecting surfaces and high-touch points, educating staff on the virus and how to protect themselves and others, reinforcing protocols such as physical distancing, hand washing, and improved security with people staying in their vehicles/sanitizing hands when handing out documents and other material.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should grocery store workers wear gloves? Masks?,"Disposable Gloves may be used by food workers but must be changed frequently and hands must be washed between glove changes and when gloves are removed. Gloves must be changed after carrying out non-food related activities such as opening/closing doors by hand, and emptying bins. Food workers should be aware that wearing gloves can allow bacteria to build up on the surface of the hands, so hand washing is extremely important when gloves are removed to avoid subsequent contamination of food. Food workers should not touch their mouth, nose and eyes when wearing gloves.Disposable gloves can give a false sense of safety and should not be used in the food work environment as a substitute for hand washing. The COVID-19 virus can contaminate disposable gloves in the same way it can get onto workers hands and contact surfaces. Removal of disposable gloves can lead to contamination of hands. Wearing disposable gloves can give you a false sense of security and may result in staff not washing hands as frequently as required.Handwashing is a greater protective barrier to infection than wearing of disposable gloves. Food businesses need to ensure adequate sanitary facilities are provided and ensure food workers thoroughly and frequently wash their hands. Soap and water is adequate for hand washing. Hand sanitisers can be used as an additional measure but should not replace hand washing.Wearing of Face MasksWHOadvice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19should be followed. Face Masks do not have to be routinely used by food workers to protect against transmission of COVID-19. However, for some food processing activities, such as working in abattoirs or handling cooked, ready-to-eat foods, wearing face masks is a usual practice.WHO recommends that face masks should be used if a person is sick with symptoms of COVID-19 (especially coughing) or looking after someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.However, a food worker who is sick or who has symptoms of COVID-19 should not be allowed to work in grocery stores or other food businesses and should be excluded from work until free of symptoms or deemed fit for work by a medical doctor.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is the protocol when an employee working in a food business becomes ill with COVID-19?,"Staff who are feeling unwell should not report to work and should seek medical advice. However, in the event that a food worker becomes unwell in the workplace with typical symptoms of COVID-19, they should be removed to an area away from other people. If possible, find a room or area where they can be isolated behind a closed door, such as a staff office. If it is possible to open a window, do so for ventilation. Arrangements should be made for the unwell employee to be removed quickly from the food premise.The employee who is unwell should follow national guidelines for reporting cases/suspect cases of COVID-19. Whilst they wait for medical advice or to be sent home, they should avoid any contact with other employees. They should avoid touching people, surfaces and objects and be advised to cover their mouth and nose with a disposable tissue when they cough or sneeze and put the tissue in a bag or pocket and then dispose of the tissue in a bin. If they do not have any tissues available, they should cough and sneeze into the crook of their elbow. If they need to go to the bathroom whilst waiting for medical assistance, they should use a separate bathroom, if available.All surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be cleaned. Alcohol based sanitizers/surface disinfectants should be used for cleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like COVID-19 virus, in concentrations of 70-80%. Common disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS) and chlorine would also have virucidal properties. All staff should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap and water after any contact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus infection.If an employee is confirmed as a case of COVID-19 it will be necessary to notify all close contacts of the infected employee so they too can take measures to minimise further risk of spread. WHO definitions of a contact of a COVID-19 case can be found here. Examples of contacts in the food businesses could include any employee who was in face-to-face or physical (i.e., touching) contact; any employee who was within 1 meter with the confirmed case; anyone who has cleaned up any bodily fluids without adequate PPE (e.g. gloves, overalls, protective clothing); employees in the same working team or workgroup as the confirmed case, and any employee living in the same household as a confirmed case.WHO recommendsthat contacts be quarantined for 14 days from the last point of exposure to the confirmed case.22 At a minimum, staff who have had close contact with the infected employee should be asked to stay at home for 14 days from the last time they had contact with the confirmed case and practice physical distancing. If they become unwell at any time within their 14-day isolation period and they test positive for COVID-19, they will become a confirmed case, and should be managed as such.Staff who have not had close contact with the original confirmed case should continue taking the usual precautions and attend work as usual. Organising employees into small teams or workgroups will help to minimise disruption to work processes in the event of an employee reporting sick with symptoms of COVID-19. Closure of the workplace is not recommended.More detailed information can be found inCOVID-19 and food safety: guidance for food businesses.For more information on contacts of COVID-19 confirmed cases, see WHO guidance on surveillance and case definitions.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
When can an employee return to work following illness? Are temperature checks appropriate?,"A return to work policy for staff who have been infected and recovered from COVID-19 should be in place. WHO recommends that a confirmed patient could be released from isolation once their symptoms resolve and they have two negative PCR tests at least 24 hours apart.If testing is not possible,WHO recommendsthat a confirmed patient can be released from isolation 14 days after symptoms resolve.Taking the temperature of food workers is not recommended. Fever is only one of the symptoms of COVID-19 and absence of fever alone is not a reliable indicator of wellness. As part of a food business fitness to work guidelines, staff should report to management if they are sick with typical COVID-19 symptoms, particularly fever.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What specific precautions do food workers need to take?,"Physical distancing, good personal hygiene with frequent hand washing, and application of general food hygiene measures are the most important precautions food workers should adopt. Physical distancing is very important to help slow the spread of coronavirus. This is achieved by minimising contact between potentially infected individuals and healthy individuals. Frequent hand washing with soap and water and use of hand sanitizers are also important in reducing the risk of transmission. All food businesses should follow the physical distancing and hand washingguidance of WHO.TheCodex Alimentarius Commissionhas adopted several practical guidelines on how to apply and implement best practices to ensure food hygiene (Codex General Principles of Food Hygiene, CXC 1- 1969), handle meats (Codex Code of Hygienic Practice for Meat, CXC 58 2005), and control viruses in foods (Guidelines for the Application of General Principles of Food Hygiene to the Control of Viruses in Food(CAC/GL 79-2012). Enhanced food safety practices at this time, such as those recommended in the Codex documents mentioned, will reduce the likelihood of contamination of foods with any pathogen and help lowering the public health burden caused by already established foodborne infections, reducing the stress on an already overburdened public health system.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How should employees maintain safe distance from one another during food production and processing?,"WHO guidelines are to maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) between fellow workers. Where the food production environment makes it difficult to do so, employers need to consider what measures to put in place to protect employees. Examples of practical measures to adhere to physical distancing guidance in the food processing environment are to:stagger workstations on either side of processing lines so that food workers are not facing one another,provide personal protection equipment (PPE) such as face masks, hair nets, disposable gloves, clean overalls and slip reduction work shoes for staff. The use of PPE would be routine in high risk areas of food premises that produce ready-to-eat and cooked foods. When staff are dressed in PPE it is possible to reduce distance between workers,space out workstations, which may require reduction in the speed of production lines,limit the number of staff in a food preparation area at any one time,organise staff into working groups or teams to facilitate reduced interaction between groups, including during change of work shifts.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How should baked goods and fresh produce be displayed in a food market/grocery store?,"It is important to maintain good hygiene practices around open food displays, with ready-to-eat food products such as salad bars, fresh produce displays and bakery products. Consumers should always be advised to wash fruits and vegetables with potable water prior to consumption. Both customers and staff should strictly observe good personal hygiene practices at all times around open food areas.In order to hygienically manage open food displays and to avoid the transmission of COVID-19 through surface contact, food retailers should:Maintain frequent washing and sanitising of all food contact surfaces and utensils;Require food service workers to frequently wash hands, and, if using gloves, these must be changed;Require food service workers to frequently clean and sanitise counters, serving utensils and condiment containers;Make available hand sanitiser for consumers on their way in and out of the food premises;Should consider not openly displaying or selling unwrapped bakery products from self-service counters. Bakery products on open, self-service displays in retail stores should be placed in plastic/cellophane or paper packaging. Where loose bakery products are displayed in retail stores, these should be placed in plexiglass display cabinets and placed in bags using tongs when customers are served.Ready-to-eat salads available in retail for self-serve, should also be placed behind plexiglass display cabinets and serving utensils should be frequently sanitized.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How should shopping trolleys or carts be disinfected?,"The handles of shopping trolleys or carts should be frequently cleaned using either alcohol-based sanitizers or chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite). Sanitizers, paper towels and trash bins should be placed outside the retail premises close to the trolley park for customers to use.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is the most appropriate sanitizer to use on surfaces in a food production environment?,"In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in concentrations of 70-80% with one-minute exposure time. Chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite) are effective for surface decontamination, as are disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS).",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Could the virus be transmitted from humans to food animals or vice versa?,"Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that food animals could be a possible route for transmission of COVID-19 to humans or that food animals can become infected by humans. Studies are underway to better understand the susceptibility of different animal species to the COVID-19 virus and to assess infection dynamics in susceptible animal species. Additional information can be found on the website of theWorld Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is known about various conditions affecting survivability of the virus?,"Very little is known about how the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives outside the human body. Probably the most up-to-date summary of scientific information we have on survival in the environment is from the European Centre for Disease control (ECDC) and the following is extracted from their recenttechnical report:Recent publications have evaluated the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces. According to van Doremalen et al., the environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 is up to three hours in the air post-aerosolization, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, albeit with significantly decreased titres [3]. These findings are comparable with results obtained for environmental stability of SARS-CoV-1. These findings resulted from experiments in a controlled environment and should be interpreted with caution in the real-life environment. Moreover, different levels of environmental contamination have been detected in rooms of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 1 out of 13 to 13 out of 15 samples testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 before cleaning. No air samples were positive in these studies, but one sample from an air exhaust outlet was positive indicating that virus particles may be displaced by air and deposited on surfaces [4,5]. In a study of environmental contamination in a Chinese hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in environmental samples from the COVID-19 dedicated intensive care units (ICU), the COVID-19 dedicated obstetric isolation ward and the COVID-19 dedicated isolation ward. SARS-CoV-2 was also detected on objects such as the self-service printers used by patients to self-print the results of their exams, desktop keyboards and doorknobs. Virus was detected most commonly on gloves (15.4% of samples) and rarely on eye protection (1.7%) [6]. This evidence shows the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment of a COVID-19 patient, therefore reinforcing the belief that fomites play a role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, the relative importance of this route of transmission compared to direct exposure to respiratory droplets is still unclear.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What measures should be taken to ensure safe transport of food during this pandemic?,"The general guidelines outlined in theCodex Code of Hygienic Practice for the Transport of Food in Bulk and Semi-Packed Food.1should be followed, in addition to ensuring that employees delivering foods are free from COVID-19, coughing/sneezing etiquette is practiced by all involved in food transport and that frequent hand washing/sanitizing is practiced and staff practice physical distancing.See also other Codes of Hygienic Practice for various groups of food.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021

How should food premises be cleaned/disinfected during this pandemic?,"The general guidelines outlined in theGeneral Principles of Food Hygienefor food processing and manufacture premises should be followed. If a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 is identified in a food premises then there is a requirement to completely clean the area with a neutral detergent, followed by decontamination of surfaces using a disinfectant effective against viruses. All surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be cleaned, including all surfaces and objects which are visibly contaminated with body fluids/respiratory secretions, and all potentially contaminated high-contact areas such as toilets, door handles, telephones. Alcohol based sanitizers/surface disinfectants should be used for cleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in concentrations of 70-80% with one-minute exposure time. Chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite) are effective for surface decontamination, as are disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS).All staff should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any contact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus infection. Staff engaged in environmental cleaning should wear PPE when performing cleaning activities, such as overalls or uniform, single-use plastic aprons, gloves and a face mask. Protective clothing (e.g. uniforms, overalls, etc.) should be frequently washed at 60Â°C or above.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021

What is the risk of contracting COVID-19 in the workplace?,"The risk of exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace depends on the likelihood of coming within 1 metre of others, in having frequent physical contact with people who may be infected with COVID-19, and through contact with contaminated surfaces and objects.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How can people assess the risk for exposure to COVID-19 in their workplace and plan for preventive measures?,"Managers with the support of an occupational health and safety advisor should carry out rapid risk assessments to determine the possibility of exposure risk in order to put in place preventive measures. This should be done for each specific work setting and each job.Low exposure risk Jobs or work without frequent, close contact with the general public or others. Workers in this group have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers. Examples of such jobs may include remote workers (i.e., working from home), office workers without frequent close contact with others and workers providing teleservices.Medium exposure risk Jobs or tasks with close, frequent contact with the general public or others. This risk level may apply to workers who have frequent and close contact with the people in high-population-density work environments (e.g. food markets, bus stations, public transport, and other work activities where physical distancing of at least 1 metre may be difficult to observe), or tasks that require close and frequent contact between co-workers. This may also include frequent contact with people returning from areas with community transmission. Examples of such jobs may include frontline workers in retail, home deliveries, accommodation, construction, police and security, public transport, and water and sanitation. High exposure risk Jobs or tasks with close contact with people who may be more likely to have COVID-19, as well as contact with objects and surfaces possibly contaminated with the virus. Examples include transporting people known or suspected to have COVID-19 without separation between the driver and the passenger, providing domestic services or home care for people with COVID-19, and having contact with the deceased who were known or suspected of having COVID-19 at the time of their death. Jobs that may fall under this category include domestic workers, social care workers, personal transport and home delivery providers and home repair technicians (plumbers, electricians) who have to provide services in the homes of people with COVID-19.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Who should carry out the workplace risk assessment?,"Employers and managers, in consultation with workers, should carry out and regularly update the risk assessment for work-related exposure to COVID-19, preferably with the support of occupational health services.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What are the key considerations for the workplace risk assessment?,"For each risk assessment, consider the environment, the task, the threat, resources available, such as personal protective equipment, and the feasibility of protective measures. The risk assessment should also extend to collective accommodation provided by the employer for workers, such as dormitories. Essential public services, such as security and police, food retail, accommodation, public transport, deliveries, water and sanitation, and other frontline workers may be at an increased risk of exposure to occupational hazards for health and safety. Workers who may be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 illness because of age or pre-existing medical conditions should be considered in the risk assessment for individuals.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"How should employers decide when to open, close or re-open workplaces and/or suspend or downscale work activities?","Deciding to close or re-open a workplace or suspend or downscale work activities should rely on the risk assessment, the capacity to put in place protective measures and the level of compliance, and recommendations of national authorities.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What key measures to protect against COVID-19 should be undertaken in ALL workplaces?,"Measures to prevent transmission of COVID-19 that apply to all workplaces and all people at the workplace include frequent hand-washing or disinfection with alcohol based hand sanitizer, respiratory hygiene such as covering coughs, physical distancing of at least 1 metre or more according to the national recommendations, wearing of masks where distancing is not possible, regular environmental cleaning and disinfection, and limiting unnecessary travel. Clear policies and messages, training, and education for staff and managers to increase awareness of COVID-19 are essential. The management of people with COVID-19 or their contacts is also critical e.g. requiring workers who are unwell or who develop symptoms to stay at home, self isolate and contact a medical professional or the local COVID-19 information line for advice on testing and referral.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What additional measures should be taken at workplaces and for jobs at medium risk?,"Workplaces for jobs at medium risk require daily cleaning and disinfection at least two times a day of objects and surfaces that are touched regularly, including all shared rooms, surfaces, floors, bathrooms, and changing rooms. Consider suspending any activity where physical distancing of at least 1 metre cannot be implemented in full. If this is not possible, increase ventilation, implement enhanced regular hand hygiene, and require staff to wear appropriate face masks, goggles, gloves and work clothes during cleaning procedures that generate splashes, providing training on their use. Organize changing and washing of work clothes at the workplace, so that workers to do take them home.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What additional measures should be taken at workplaces and for jobs at high risk?,"In work areas at high risk, assess the possibility of suspending the activity; enhance regular hand hygiene; provide medical masks, disposable gowns, gloves, and eye protection for workers who must work in the homes of people who are suspected or known to have COVID-19; train workers in infection prevention and control practices and use of personal protective equipment; avoid assigning tasks with high risk to workers who have pre-existing medical conditions, are pregnant, or older than 60 years of age.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What should be taken into consideration when setting a physical distance at the workplace?,"WHO recommends keeping a physical distance of at least 1 metre between each person in all settings, including in workplaces. Because transmission can occur in crowded workplaces, WHO recommends providing sufficient space, at least 10 square meters, for every worker. National recommendations for physical distancing may require greater physical distance and should be complied with. In order to support compliance with national or local recommendations, implement physical distance guidelines in a way that is practical and feasible in the context of work tasks, and which is acceptable to both workers and employers. Stimulate workers to comply with physical distancing norms also at events outside the workplace, in the community, and in dormitories. Risk assessment and consultation between employers and workers is very important for setting up and implementing physical distancing measures at the workplace. This may require modification of workstations, changing the use of common spaces and transport vehicles, staggered work shifts, split teams and other measures to reduce social mixing at the workplace. If physical distancing measures at the workplace are not feasible for specific work tasks, consider whether the work can be suspended, and if this is not possible, apply additional protective measures, such as the use of screens, sneeze guards, face masks, enhanced hand hygiene, ventilation and disinfection.Physical distancing alone cant prevent COVID-19 transmission, it is important that it is combined with other public health measures, such as hand and respiratory hygiene, environmental clean-up and disinfection of commonly touched surfaces and objects, ventilation, wearing face masks and a policy of staying at home if unwell.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How can workplaces plan for the prevention and mitigation of COVID-19?,"Workplaces should develop action plans to prevent and mitigate COVID-19 as part of the business continuity plan and according to the results of the risk assessments and the epidemiological situation. The action plan and preventive measures should be regularly monitored and updated. Workers and their representatives should be consulted and should participate in the development, monitoring and updating of the workplace COVID-19. It is very important to monitor the effectiveness of preventive measures, and the compliance of workers, visitors, customers, clients and sub-contractors with the measures. The plans should be updated when someone with known or suspected COVID-19 is at the workplace.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can the return to the workplace be immediate after public measures are lifted?,"The return to work premises should be carefully planned ahead, with preventive measures put in place according to the risk assessment of the different jobs and work tasks. All possible risks for safety and health should be assessed, such as risks resulting from reduced maintenance of machines and facilities during the closure period. If a return to work is rushed and not done in a phased and cautious manner, it puts lives at risk, and threatens to undermine efforts to restore social and economic activity.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Does WHO recommend thermal testing of people entering a workplace?,"Temperature screening cannot detect all cases of COVID-19, since infected individuals may not have fever early in the course of infection or illness, such as during the incubation period or just before other symptoms begin, even though they may already be infectious. Some people may reduce fever with a fever-reducing medication if they are concerned about the possible consequences of not coming to work. Relying on temperature screening alone will not stop the spread of COVID-19 at work. Thermal screening at the workplace can be considered part of a package of measures to prevent and control COVID-19 at the workplace. Workers should be encouraged to self-monitor their health, possibly with the use of questionnaires, and take their own temperature regularly at home. Workplaces should adopt stay at home if unwellÂ and flexible sick leave policies to discourage workers with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 from coming to the workplaces.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"Does WHO recommend workers wear masks at the workplace (office or others)? If yes, what type of masks?","Wearing masks depends on the risk assessment. For jobs and tasks that carry a medium or high risk, for people aged 60 and older, and for those with underlying health conditions, a medical mask and other personal protective equipment should be provided. Fabric masks or face coverings are currently recommended for younger people and those with no symptoms where physical distancing is not achievable. This prevents the spread of virus from the wearer (who could have COVID-19 but no symptoms) to others. The policy on wearing a mask or face covering in low risk workplaces should be in line with national or local guidelines. Masks may carry some risks if not used properly.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Are there any directives on office ventilation and air conditioning use?,"There should be fresh, clean air in all workplaces. For jobs and work tasks at medium or high risk of exposure, WHO recommends an increased ventilation rate through natural aeration or artificial ventilation, preferably without re-circulation of the air. In case of air recirculation, filters should be cleaned regularly.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What mental health and psychosocial support should be provided to workers during COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is associated with a range of concerns, such as fear of falling ill and dying, of being socially excluded, placed in quarantine, or losing a livelihood. Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common reactions for people in the context of COVID-19. Mental health and psychosocial support should be made available to all workers.

What is herd immunity?,"Herd immunity', also known as 'population immunity', is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection. WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through any segment of the population,as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths.Herd immunityagainst COVID-19 should beachieved by protecting peoplethrough vaccination,not by exposing them to the pathogen that causes the disease.Read the Director-Generals12 October media briefing speechfor more detail.Vaccines train our immune systems to create proteins that fight disease, known as antibodies, just as would happen when we are exposed to a disease but crucially vaccines work without making us sick. Vaccinated people are protected from getting the disease in question and passing onthepathogen, breaking any chains of transmission.Visit ourwebpageon COVID-19 and vaccines for more detail.To safely achieveherd immunityagainst COVID-19, a substantial proportion of a populationwould need to bevaccinated, lowering the overall amount of virusable to spreadin the whole population.One of the aims with working towards herd immunity is to keepvulnerable groups who cannot get vaccinated(e.g. due to health conditions like allergic reactions to the vaccine) safeand protectedfrom the disease.Read ourQ&Aon vaccines and immunization for more information.The percentage of people who need tobe immunein order to achieve herd immunityvaries with each disease. For example, herd immunity against measles requires about 95% of a population to be vaccinated. The remaining 5% will be protected by the fact that measles will not spread among those who are vaccinated. For polio, the threshold is about 80%.The proportion of the population that must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to begin inducing herd immunity is not known.This is an important area of research and will likely vary according to the community, the vaccine, the populations prioritized for vaccination, and other factors.Achieving herd immunity with safe and effective vaccines makes diseases rarer and saves lives.Find out more about the science behind herd immunity by watching or reading thisinterviewwith WHOs Chief Scientist, Dr Soumya Swaminathan.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is WHOs position on herd immunity as a way of fighting COVID-19?,"Attempts to reach herd immunity through exposing people to a virus are scientifically problematic and unethical. Letting COVID-19 spread through populations, of any age or health status will lead to unnecessary infections, suffering and death.The vast majority of people in most countries remain susceptible to this virus. Seroprevalence surveys suggest that in most countries, less than 10% of the population have been infected with COVID-19. We are still learning about immunity to COVID-19. Most people who are infected with COVID-19 develop an immune response within the first few weeks, but we dont know how strong or lasting that immune response is, or how it differs for different people. There have also been reports of people infected with COVID-19 for a second time. Until we better understand COVID-19 immunity, it will not be possible to know how much of a population is immune and how long that immunity last for, let alone make future predictions. These challenges should preclude any plans that try to increase immunity within a population by allowing people to get infected. Although older people and those with underlying conditions are most at risk of severe disease and death, they are not the only ones at risk. Finally, while most infected people get mild or moderate forms of COVID-19 and some experience no disease, many become seriously ill and must be admitted into hospital. We are only beginning to understand the long-term health impacts among people who have had COVID-19, including what is being described as Long COVID. WHO is working with clinicians and patient groups to better understand the long term effects of COVID-19. ",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What do we know about immunity from COVID-19?,"Most people who are infected with COVID-19 develop an immune response within the first few weeks after infection. Research is still ongoing into how strong that protection is and how long it lasts. WHO is also looking into whether the strength and length of immune response depends on the type of infection a person has: without symptoms (asymptomatic), mild or severe. Even people without symptoms seem to develop an immune response. Globally, data from seroprevalence studies suggests that less 10% of those studied have been infected, meaning that the vast majority of the worlds population remains susceptible to this virus. For other coronaviruses such as the common cold, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) immunity declines over time, as is the case with other diseases. While people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus develop antibodies and immunity, we do not yet know how long it lasts.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is WHOs position on lockdowns as a way of fighting COVID-19?,"Large scale physical distancing measures and movement restrictions, often referred to as lockdowns, can slow COVIDâ19 transmission by limiting contact between people. However, these measures can have a profound negative impact on individuals, communities, and societies by bringing social and economic life to a near stop. Such measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, including people in poverty, migrants, internally displaced people and refugees, who most often live in overcrowded and under resourced settings, and depend on daily labour for subsistence. WHO recognizes that at certain points, some countries have had no choice but to issue stay-at-home orders and other measures, to buy time. Governments must make the most of the extra time granted by lockdown measures by doing all they can to build their capacities to detect, isolate, test and care for all cases; trace and quarantine all contacts; engage, empower and enable populations to drive the societal response and more. WHO is hopeful that countries will use targeted interventions where and when needed, based on the local situation.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 be cared for at home?,"People with no symptoms should be able to stay at home, if adequately isolated from others, but this should be confirmed by a doctor. Those with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if they are under the age of 60, do not smoke, are not obese,and do not have other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease,cancer,chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression. A health worker will assess risk factors along with the persons symptoms, medical history and ability for the family to manage the care. Household members need to limit shared spaces, practice the recommended hygiene and know how to recognize and respond to signs of worsening health.A trained health worker will need to assess whether the home in question is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, and proper infection prevention control measures are put in place. Trained health workers are also important to support the patient and family in the home, or by phone, telemedicine, or outreach teams.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What should be done to prevent other people in the house from becoming sick if a person with COVID-19 is being cared for at home?,"There are a number of precautions that can prevent the spread of COVID-19 to other people in the house:The ill person should stay in a separate room. If this is not possible, then keep at least a 1-metre distance from them. The sick person and anyone else in the same room should wear a medical mask. Provide good ventilation in the room of the ill person and shared spaces, and open windows if possible and safe to do so.See our Q&A on ventilation.The ill person should wear a medical mask as much as possible, in particular when not alone in the room and when at least a 1-metre distance from others cannot be maintained.Visitors should not be allowed in the home.Limit the number of caregivers to one person with no underlying conditions, if possible.Caregivers and household members should wear a medical mask while in the same room with an ill person, not touch their mask or face during use, discard the mask after leaving the room, and wash their hands afterward.The ill person should have dedicated dishes, cups, eating utensils, towels and bed linens. They should be washed with soap and water, and not shared.Frequently touched surfaces by the ill person should be cleaned and disinfected at least daily.Everyone in the household should wash their hands with soap and water regularly, especially: after coughing or sneezingbefore during and after you prepare foodbefore eatingafter using the toiletbefore and after caring for the ill personwhen hands are visibly dirty. A cough or sneeze should be covered with a flexed elbow or a disposable tissue that is discarded immediately after use.The waste from the ill person should be packed in strong closed bags before disposal.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How long should people with COVID-19 stay at home and in isolation?,"People with COVID-19 who are cared for at home should stay in isolation until they are no longer able to transmit the virus to others:Those with symptoms should stay isolated for a minimum of 10 days after the first day they developed symptoms, plus another 3 days after the end of symptoms when they are without fever and without respiratory symptoms.People without symptoms should stay isolated for a minimum of 10 days after testing positive.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
When should a patient with COVID-19 be cared for at home?,"Ideally, all patients with COVID-19 are cared for in a healthcare facility. However, there may be some circumstances where patients may not require hospitalization or inpatient care is unavailable or unsafe, such as when capacity is insufficient to meet the demand for healthcare services. Patients should be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the health worker to determine where their care needs can best be met.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What factors determine whether a COVID-19 patient can be cared for at home?,"Patients with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if the home setting is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, and if the patient is under the age of 60, does not smoke, is not obese,and does not have other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease,cancer,chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression. An assessment about home care for each patient should be based on the following factors:Clinical evaluation of the patient.Evaluation of the patients home setting according to infection prevention and control (IPC) criteria (e.g., ability to carry out hand and respiratory hygiene, environmental cleaning, adequate ventilation, limitations on movement around or from the house).Presence of vulnerable people at higher risk of COVID-19 in the home.Ability of a caregiver to provide care and closely monitor the evolution of the patients health, at least once per day, and to recognize signs and symptoms of any worsening of the health status. Availability of trained health workers to support the patient and caregiver (home-based, phone, telemedicine, trained community workers or outreach teams). If adequate isolation from others in the home and infection prevention control measures cannot be ensured, then isolation in designated community facilities or a health facility may need to be arranged, with consent from the patient and in agreement with the caregiver and household members. It is important to note that in areas with other endemic infections that cause fever, such as influenza, malaria, dengue, etc., febrile patients should seek medical care, be tested and treated for those endemic infections per routine protocols, irrespective of the presence of respiratory signs and symptoms. Home care does not replace healthcare by professionals. Those patients who receive homecare should be regularly monitored by health workers.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What additional factors should be taken into consideration when assessing the home setting to determine if it is safe for patients and families to remain at home?,There are a number of environmental and social factors to consider for patients to safely remain at home with their families or household members. An overall needs assessment of the patient and family that includes the availability of trained health workers for support should be conducted.,World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What precautions should health workers take when providing care to patients in home settings?,"Health workers should take the following precautions:Perform a risk assessment to select the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a medical mask, eye protection, gloves and gown when caring for the patient.Implement infection prevention and control measures, including hand hygiene.Ensure the room where the patient is cared for is well ventilated, opening windows if necessary.Provide instructions to caregivers and household members on cleaning and disinfection in the home, and on management of waste, laundry and utensils related to the patient.Request the patient to wear a medical mask when providing care or within a 1-metre distance.Request limiting the number of household members during visits and maintaining at least a 1-metre distance.Remove PPE and discard what is disposable, then perform hand hygiene before leaving the home.Make sure that the waste generated from providing care to the patient be placed in strong bags or safety boxes as appropriate, closed completely, disposed as infectious waste and removed from the home.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Could pregnant women be cared for at home if they have COVID-19?,"Pregnant women with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if the home setting is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, if they do not smoke, are not obese,and do not have other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease,cancer,chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression. An assessment about home care for each patient should be based on the following factors:Clinical evaluation of the patient.Evaluation of the patients home setting according to IPC criteria (e.g., ability to carry out hand and respiratory hygiene, environmental cleaning, limitations on movement around or from the house).Presence of vulnerable people at higher risk of COVID-19 in the home.Ability of a caregiver to provide care and closely monitor the evolution of the patients health, at least once per day, and to recognize signs and symptoms of any worsening of the health status.

Can children be cared for at home if they have COVID-19?,"Children should be kept together with their parents or caregivers wherever possible. Children with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if the home setting is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, if they are not obese, do not smoke, and do not have other conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease,cancer,chronic kidney disease, or immunosuppression.Caregivers of children with COVID-19 should monitor for signs and symptoms of clinical deterioration requiring urgent re-evaluation. These include difficulty breathing/fast or shallow breathing (for infants: grunting, inability to breastfeed), blue lips or face, chest pain or pressure, new confusion, inability to awaken/not interacting when awake, inability to drink or keep down any liquids. If caregivers are suspected or have confirmed COVID-19 infection, medical and non-medical factors must be taken into account due to the negative and possible long-term consequences of even a short period of family separation.Community protection focal points and caseworkers should help families planâin advanceâagreements for the care of children in case the caregiver becomes ill. Children living with primary caregivers who are elderly, disabled or have underlying health conditions should be prioritized.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How does COVID-19 spread between people?,"COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people, mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another person.The virus can spread from an infected persons mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe heavily. These liquid particles are different sizes, ranging from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.Other people can catch COVID-19 when the virus gets into their mouth, nose or eyes, which is more likely to happen when people are in direct or close contact (less than 1 metre apart) with an infected person.Current evidence suggests that the main way the virus spreads is by respiratory droplets among people who are in close contact with each other.Aerosol transmission can occur in specific settings, particularly in indoor, crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces, where infected person(s) spend long periods of time with others, such as restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices and/or places of worship. More studies are underway to better understand the conditions in which aerosol transmission is occurring outside of medical facilities where specific medical procedures, called aerosol generating procedures, are conducted.The virus can also spread after infected people sneeze, cough on, or touch surfaces, or objects, such as tables, doorknobs and handrails. Other people may become infected by touching these contaminated surfaces, then touching their eyes, noses or mouths without having cleaned their hands first.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
When do infected people transmit the virus?,"Whether or not they have symptoms, infected people can be contagious and the virus can spread from them to other people.Laboratory data suggests that infected people appear to be most infectious just before they develop symptoms (namely 2 days before they develop symptoms) and early in their illness. People who develop severe disease can be infectious for longer.While someone who never develops symptoms can pass the virus to others, it is still not clear how frequently this occurs and more research is needed in this area.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is the difference between people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic? Dont they both mean someone without symptoms?,"Both terms refer topeople who do not have symptoms. The difference is that asymptomatic refers to people who are infected but never develop any symptoms, while pre-symptomatic refers to infected people who have not yet developed symptoms but go on to develop symptoms later.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Are there certain settings where COVID-19 can spread more easily?,"Any situation in which people are in close proximity to one another for long periods of time increases the risk of transmission. Indoor locations, especially settings where there is poor or no ventilation, are riskier than outdoor locations.Transmission can occur more easily in the Three CsÂ:Crowded places with many people nearby;Close-contact settings, especially where people have conversations very near each other;Confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. The risk of COVID-19 spreading is higher in places where these overlap.In health facilities, some medical procedures, called aerosol generating procedures, can produce very small droplets (called droplet nuclei or aerosols) that can stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time. This is why health workers performing these procedures take specific airborne protection measures, including using appropriate personal protective equipment, including respirators, and why visitors are not permitted in areas in which these procedures are being performed.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How can I reduce my risk of getting COVID-19?,"To limit the risks of getting COVID-19 follow these basic precautions:Follow local guidance. Check to see what national, regional and local authorities are advising so you have the most relevant information for where you are.Stay at least 1 metre away from others, even if they dont appear to be sick.Wear a mask, especially when you cant physically distance. Read our Masks and COVID-19 Q&A and watch our videos on how to wear and make masks.Manage your risks by thinking about location and setting of the event, proximity to others and time you will be at the event. In other words, consider where you are going, how close you will be to other people and how long you will be there. Avoid crowded places and events, poorly ventilated indoor locations and prolonged contact with others.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"What are the recommendation regarding disinfection of vehicles, goods and products coming from China or other COVID-19 affected countries?","To date there is no epidemiological information to suggest that contact with goods, products or vehicles shipped from COVID-19 affected countries have been the source of COVID-19 in humans.For these reasons, there is no disinfection recommendations for any goods and products coming from COVID-19 affected countries given that there is no available evidence that these products pose a risk to public health. WHO will continue to closely monitor the evolution of COVID-19,and will update the recommendations as needed.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used by healthcare workers (HCW) performing nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19?,"Health care workers collecting NP and OP swab specimens from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients should be well-trained on the procedure and should wear a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeve gown, a medical mask, eye protection (i.e., googles or face shield), and gloves. Procedure should be conducted in a separate/isolation room, and during NP specimen collection health care workers should request the patients to cover their mouth with a medical mask or tissue. Although collection of NP and OP swabs have the potential to induce fits of coughing from the patient undergoing the procedure, there is no currently available evidence that cough generated via NP/OP specimen collection leads to increased risk of COVID-19 transmission via aerosols.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"Are boots, impermeable aprons, or coverall suits required as routine personal protective equipment (PE) for healthcare workers (HCW) caring for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection?","No. Current WHO guidance for HCW caring for suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients recommends the use of contact and droplet precautions, in addition to standard precautions which should always be used by all HCW for all patients. In terms of PPE, contact and droplet precautions include wearing disposable gloves to protect hands, and clean, non-sterile, long-sleeve gown to protect clothes from contamination, medical masks to protect nose and mouth, and eye protection (e.g., goggles, face shield), before entering the room where suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients are admitted. Respirators (e.g. N95) are only required for aerosol generating procedures.Click here for more information on PPE for HCW caring for suspected or confirmed nCoV patients.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Do patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV need to be hospitalized if they have mild illness?,"No. For patients who have mild illness, e.g., low-grade fever, cough, malaise, rhinorrhoea, sore throat without any warning signs, such as shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing, increased respiratory (i.e. sputum or haemoptysis), gastro-intestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea and without changes in mental status, hospitalization may not be required unless there is concern for rapid clinical deterioration. All patients discharged home should be instructed to return to hospital if they develop any worsening of illness.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Are specialized or referral hospitals required for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection when hospitalization is needed?,"No. Current WHO recommendations do not include a requirement for exclusive use of specialized or referral hospitals to treat suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients. However, countries or local jurisdictions may choose to care for patients at such hospitals if those are deemed the most likely to be able to safely care for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or for other clinical reasons (e.g., availability of advanced life support). Regardless, any healthcare facility treating patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV patients should adhere to the WHO infection prevention and control recommendations for healthcare to protect patients, staff and visitors.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Why should people wear masks?,"Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives. Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive Do it all! approach including physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, good ventilation, cleaning hands, covering sneezes and coughs, and more. Depending on the type, masks can be used for either protection of healthy persons or to prevent onward transmission.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Who should wear what kind of mask?,"Medical masks are recommended for: Health workers in clinical settings. Anyone who is feeling unwell, including people with mild symptoms, such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue.Anyone awaiting COVID-19 test results or who has tested positive.People caring for someone who is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 outside of health facilities. Medical masks are also recommended for the following groups, because they are at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 and dying: People aged 60 or over. People of any age with underlying health conditions, including chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, immunocompromised patients and diabetes mellitus. Non-medical, fabric masks can be used by the general public under the age of 60 and who do not have underlying health conditions. ",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
When should masks be worn by the general public?,"In areas where the virus is circulating, masks should be worn when youre in crowded settings, where you cant be at least 1 metre from others, and in rooms with poor or unknown ventilation. Its not always easy to determine the quality of ventilation, which depends on the rate of air change, recirculation and outdoor fresh air. So if you have any doubts, its safer to simply wear a mask. You should always clean your hands before and after using a mask, and before touching it while wearing it. While wearing a mask, you should still keep physical distance from others as much as possible. Wearing a mask does not mean you can have close contact with people. For indoor public settings such as busy shopping centres, religious buildings, restaurants, schools and public transport, you should wear a mask if you cannot maintain physical distance from others. If a visitor comes to your home who is not a member of the household, wear a mask if you cannot maintain a physical distance or the ventilation is poor. When outside, wear a mask if you cannot maintain physical distance from others. Some examples are busy markets, crowded streets and bus stops.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should I wear a mask while exercising?,"Even when youre in an area of COVID-19 transmission, masks should not be worn during vigorous physical activity because of the risk of reducing your breathing capacity. No matter how intensely you exercise, keep at least 1 metre away from others, and if youre indoors, make sure there is adequate ventilation.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"How do I choose what fabric mask to buy, or ideal fit and fabrics if I make my own?","Check for filtration, breathability and fit when choosing a fabric mask. It should be held in place comfortably with little adjustment using elastic bands or ties. There are different mask shapes such as flat-fold or duckbill find the one that fits closely over your nose, cheeks and chin. When the edges of the mask are not close to the face and shift, such as when speaking, air penetrates through the edges of the mask rather than being filtered through the fabric. Masks with vents or exhalation valves are not advised because they allow unfiltered breath to escape the mask.Fabric masks should be made of three layers of fabric:Inner layer of absorbent material, such as cotton.Middle layer of non-woven non-absorbent material, such as polypropylene.Outer layer of non-absorbent material, such as polyester or polyester blend. If purchasing a fabric mask from a store, check to make sure it meets national performance standards. Watch the video on WHOs recommended fabric mask materials and composition for more information.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How should I wear and clean a fabric mask?,"How to put on and wear a fabric mask:Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.Inspect the mask for tears or holes, do not use a mask that is damaged.Adjust the mask to cover your mouth, nose, and chin, leaving no gaps on the sides.Place the straps behind your head or ears. Do not cross the straps because this can cause gaps on the side of your face.Avoid touching the mask while wearing it. If you touch it, clean your hands.Change your mask if it gets dirty or wet.How to take off and store a fabric mask:Clean your hands before taking off the mask.Take off the mask by removing it from the ear loops, without touching the front of the mask.If your fabric mask is not dirty or wet and you plan to reuse it, put it in a clean plastic, resealable bag. If you need to use it again, hold the mask at the elastic loops when removing it from the bag. Clean your mask once a day.Clean your hands after removing the mask.How to clean a fabric mask:Wash fabric masks in soap or detergent and preferably hot water (at least 60 degrees Centigrade/140 degrees Fahrenheit) at least once a day.If it is not possible to wash the mask in hot water, then wash it in soap/detergent and room temperature water, followed by boiling the mask for 1 minute.General tips:Make sure to clean your hands before touching your mask.Make sure you have your own mask and do not share it with others.Resist the temptation to pull down your mask to your chin or take if off when speaking to other people. Do not store your mask around your arm or wrist or pull it down to rest around your chin or neck. Instead, store it in a clean plastic bag.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"How should I put on, wear and take off a medical mask?","How to put on and take off a medical mask:Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. Inspect the mask for tears or holes; do not use a mask that has previously been worn or is damaged. Verify which side is the top this is usually where the metal strip is. Then, identify the inside of the mask, which is usually the white side. Place the mask on your face covering your nose, mouth and chin, making sure that there are no gaps between your face and the mask. Place the straps behind your head or ears. Do not cross the straps because this can cause gaps on the side of the mask.Pinch the metal strip so it moulds to the shape of your nose.Remember, do not touch the front of the mask while using it to avoid contamination; if you accidentally touch it, clean your hands. How to take off a medical mask:Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.Remove the straps from behind the head or ears, without touching the front of the mask. As you remove the mask, lean forward and pull the mask away from your face. Medical masks are for single use only; discard the mask immediately, preferably into a closed bin. Clean your hands after touching the mask.Be aware of the condition of the mask; replace it if it gets soiled or damp.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"What is the difference between medical masks and respirators, like N95s?","Medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are:composed of 3 layers of synthetic nonwoven materialsconfigured to have filtration layers sandwiched in the middleavailable in different thicknesseshave various levels of fluid-resistance and filtrationRespirators (also known as filtering facepiece respirators FFP) are available at different performance levels such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99.Medical masks and respirator masks are similar in their protection value. However, respirators are specific for certain procedures and instances because they have a tightly fitted component to them. Respirator masks are designed to protect healthcare workers who provide care to COVID-19 patients in settings and areas where aerosol generating procedures are undertaken. Healthcare workers should be fit tested before using a respirator to ensure that they are wearing the correct size. Wearing a loose-fitting respirator will not offer the same protection to the wearer and may allow small particles to get inside the mask through the sides.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Does WHO recommend the use of masks with exhalation valves to prevent transmission of COVID-19?,"No, WHO does not advise using masks or respirators with exhalation valves. These masks are intended for industrial workers to prevent dust and particles from being breathed in as the valve closes on inhale. However, the valve opens on exhale, making it easier to breathe but also allowing any virus to pass through the valve opening. This makes the mask ineffective at preventing the spread of COVID-19 or any other respiratory virus.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Does WHO recommend the use of gloves in the community to prevent transmission of COVID-19?,"No, WHO does not advise using gloves by people in the community. Instead, WHO encourages the installation of public hand hygiene stations at the entrance and exit of public places, such as supermarkets or public/private buildings. This helps reduce germs brought in by peoples hands. By widely improving hand hygiene practices, countries can help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus and other infections.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
When should health workers wear masks in the context of COVID-19?,"Health workers are the most likely to be exposed to COVID-19 because they are in close contact with patients with suspected, probable or confirmed COVID-19.In areas of community or cluster transmission, health workers, caregivers and visitors should wear a mask at all times when in the health facility, even if physical distancing can be maintained. Masks should be worn throughout their shifts, apart from when eating, drinking or needing to change the mask for specific reasons:Health workers and caregivers include: doctors, nurses, midwives, medical attendants, cleaners, community health workers, and any others working in clinical areas.Health workers must remember to combine hand hygiene with any time they touch their mask or face, before and after putting on and removing their masks, as well as before they touch them to readjust them. In areas with sporadic spread of COVID-19, health workers in clinical areas should wear medical masks throughout their shift apart from when eating, drinking or needing to change the mask for specific reasons. Health workers should continue to physically distance and avoid unnecessary close contact with colleagues and others in the facility when not providing patient care. Respirator masks are recommended for use where aerosol generating procedures are in place for a suspect/confirmed COVID-19 patient. In these settings, WHO recommends the use of airborne and contact precautions.Ashealth workers have been infected with COVID-19 outside of health facilities, it is critical that health workers, as all people, follow the guidance to protect themselves from infection when outside of a health facility.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How large does a meeting or event need to be in order to be a mass gathering?,"High profile international sporting events such as the Olympics or World Cups as well as international religious events such as the Hajj count as mass gatherings. However, lower profile conferences and events can also meet WHOs definition of a mass gathering. An event counts as a mass gatheringsÂ if the number of people it brings together is so large that it has the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community where it takes place. You need to consider the location and duration of the event as well as the number of participants. For example, if the event takes place over several days in a small island state where the capacity of the health system is quite limited then even an event with just a few thousand participants could place a big strain on the health system and then be considered a mass gatheringÂ event. Conversely, if the event is held in a big city in a country with a large, well-resourced health system and lasts just a few hours, the event may not constitute a mass gathering event.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Does WHO recommend that all international mass gatherings be cancelled because of COVID-19?,"No. As each international mass gathering is different, the factors to consider when determining if the event should be cancelled may also differ. Any decision to change a planned international gathering should be based on a careful assessment of the risks and how they can be managed, and the level of event planning. The assessment should involve all stakeholders in the event, and in particular the health authorities in the country or community where the event is due to take place. These authorities and stakeholders are in the best position to assess the level of stress the event might place on the local health system and emergency services and whether this level of stress is acceptable in the current situation. It is WHOs view that all countries with community transmission should seriously consider postponing or reducing mass gatherings that bring people together and have the potential to amplify disease and support the recommended best practice of physical distancing. Any decision will be supported through the use of WHO tools, in particular the Risk Assessment for Mass Gatherings during COVID-19. If movement restrictions and further national measures have been established in the country, the WHO RA does not apply. However, when the process of re-opening/conducting mass gatherings is being considered post movement restrictions, it will be key to ensure any decisions are based on a risk assessment, such as the WHO Mass gatherings COVID-19 risk assessment.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not?,"For countries not currently known to be experiencing community transmission of COVID-19, the priority consideration will be whether the planned mass gathering event substantially increases the risk of the virus entering the country and becoming established, as well as the risk for participants to importing infection back to their home country and further increasing global spread. In making this assessment, the organizers and their national or local health authorities should recognize that the risk of imported cases of COVID-19 is naturally linked to international travel. They should also recognize that it is neither realistic or desirable to aim for zero risk. When organizers and health authorities are determining whether to hold a mass gathering, they should determine what is an acceptable risk and what additional measures should be implemented to mitigate the risks.For countries where COVID-19 has already started to spread in the community, key consideration will be: aiming at containing or at least slowing down the spread of the virus in the local community/country.preventing participants from other countries being infected with COVID-19 In each case the risk should be considered in the context of the known features of COVID-19, its severity, its transmissibility and the effectiveness of measures to prevent or reduce transmission. The strain already placed on the local health system in responding to COVID-19 outbreak(s), and the additional strain the mass gathering might place on the system also need to be taken into account.You can find more advice on what to look at in the WHO document Key planning recommendations for Mass Gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak of 14 February 2020. See: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-the-current-covid-19-outbreak",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What if my organization does not have the expertise to assess the risks COVID-19 poses for our planned mass gathering?,The national and local public health authorities in the country where you plan to hold the mass gathering will most likely know how to conduct a health risk assessment. If there is a WHO Country Office there they may also be able to provide some expert support. So too might the WHO Regional Office in your part of the world. You can find the names and contact details of the WHO Regional Offices at https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/regional-offices,World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"If we go ahead with an international mass gathering, what can we do to reduce the risk of participants catching COVID-19?","Promote hand washing, respiratory hygiene and social distancing at the event. Make sure you have emergency contact details for all participants, including where they are staying during the event. You should make it clear to them that this information will be shared with the local public health authorities to enable rapid contact tracing if a participant at the event becomes ill with COVID-19. The event organisers need to have an agreed preparedness plan in case one or more participants become ill with COVID-19 symptoms. This should include rapid isolation of the ill person and their safe transfer to a local health facility. You should consider whether the number of participants at the event could be reduced, making available participation by video or teleconference and possibly screening participants for COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fever, malaise) at points of entry to the venue. You can find advice on how individual participants can protect themselves and their loved ones from COVID-19 at: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Are pregnant women at higher risk from COVID-19?,"Pregnant women or recently pregnant women who are older, overweight, and have pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes seem to have an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19. When pregnant women develop severe disease, they also seem to more often require care in intensive care units than non-pregnant women of reproductive age.Due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, we know that pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections. It is therefore important that they take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, and report possible symptoms (including fever, cough or difficulty in breathing) to their healthcare provider.WHO will continue to review and update its information and advice as more evidence becomes available.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Im pregnant. How can I protect myself against COVID-19?,"Pregnant women should take the same precautions to avoid COVID-19 infection as other people. You can help protect yourself by:Washing your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.Keeping space between yourself and others and avoiding crowded spaces. Wear a non-medical, fabric mask where it is not possible to keep sufficient physical distance between yourself and others.Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth.Practicing respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.If you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Call before going to a health facility, and follow the directions of your local health authority. Pregnant women and women who have recently delivered should attend their routine care appointments, according to local policies and following adapted measures to reduce possible transmission of the virus.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should pregnant women be tested for COVID-19?,"Testing protocols and eligibility during pregnancy vary depending on where you live.However, WHO recommendations are that pregnant women with symptoms of COVID-19 should be prioritized for testing. If they have COVID-19, they may need specialized care.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can COVID-19 be passed from a woman to her unborn or newborn baby?,"We still do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus to her fetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery.

What is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new coronavirus, which has not been previously identified in humans. In most cases, COVID-19 causes mild symptoms including dry cough, tiredness and fever, though fever may not be a symptom for some older people. Other mild symptoms include aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea. Some people become infected but dont develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who get COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How is COVID-19 transmitted?,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Who is at risk of developing severe disease?,"Older people, and people of all ages with pre-existing medical conditions (such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, or cancer) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What can I do to prevent infection?,"To prevent infection, there are a five things that you can do. 1.Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water and dry them thoroughly. You can also use alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty and if this product is available. Cleaning your hands frequently will remove the virus if it is on your hands. You can learn how to wash your hands in this video (or this visual).If an alcohol-based hand rub or soap is not available, then using chlorinated water (0.05%) for handwashing is an option, but it is not ideal because frequent use may irritate your skin. 2.Cover your mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when coughing and sneezing. And remember to throw away the used tissue immediately in a bin with a lid and to wash your hands. This way you protect others from any virus released through coughs and sneezes. 3.Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces which can be contaminated with the virus. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself. 4.Keep physical distance from others. If your national or local authorities have put in place confinement measures, it is important to respect them. Taking exercise outside is good for your physical and mental health, but should only be undertaken if regulations for your area allow it. When you do go out, avoid crowded spaces and maintain at least 1 metre distance (3 feet or arms-length) from others. Avoid unnecessary visits to your house. If visits are necessary (e.g. caregiver to support with activities of daily living), ask your visitor to regularly check for symptoms to ensure that they are symptom free when visiting you. Ask them to also follow these five key actions, including washing their hands when they first enter your home. 5. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces every day. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, taps, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. ",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What can older people do to prepare for COVID-19 in their community?,"There is a lot that you can do to prepare for COVID-19 in your community. Inform yourself of the special measures taken in your community as well as the services and the sources of reliable information that are availableduring the health emergency (e.g. home deliveries, psychosocial support, health ministry website, alternative access to your pension).Create a list of the basic supplies that you will need for at least two weeks and try to get these delivered where possible (e.g. non-perishable food items, household products, batteries for assistive devices you may use, and prescription medicines). Alternatively, ask family members, caregivers, neighbours or community leaders to help with ordering and/or delivery of groceries or prescription medicines. Make sure that your mobile phone credit is topped up and identify a safe place to charge your phone regularly so that you can keep in contact with family and friends and reach emergency services if needed. Make a list of emergency numbers (e.g. COVID-19 local helpline, nearby hospital and health emergencies numbers, hotline for victims of abuse, psychosocial support hotline) and support contacts (e.g. family members and friends, main caregiver, community care worker, associations of older persons). If you live alone, you may wish to share this list and ask your neighbours, family or caregiver to be in touch regularly, for example, by phone or video chat. Discuss with your health-care worker how your health needs can be addressed during COVID-19. This may involve postponing non-urgent appointments, talking to your doctor or health-care worker by phone or video chat instead of in person and/or revising your vaccination schedule.If you rely on the support provided by a caregiver, identify with him or her another person that you trust to support your daily living and care needs in case your caregiver is unable to continue to provide care. Together, you can note down all the personal care and assistance that you require and how it should be provided and share it with this trusted person so that they can be ready to provide care in case of need.If you are the primary caregiver of another person who is care dependent (e.g. grandchild, older spouse, child with a disability), identify a person that you and the person that you care for trust to take on your caregiving responsibilities in case you fall sick. Local authorities or volunteer organizations that provide support in these situations in your community might be able to help.If multiple people live in your home, if possible prepare a separate room or space in your home so that anyone showing symptoms compatible with COVID-19 can be isolated from others. If you do not have space for self-isolation, contact your community leaders or local health authorities to see if there is community space that could help you or other household members self-isolate.Think about what matters most to you regarding care and support, including medical treatment, in case something happens to you and you are unable to make your own decisions. If you want to develop an advanced care plan to record your treatment and care wishes, you can talk about it with your health-care worker or someone that you trust. You can write down your wishes and share them with people you trust.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How can I keep healthy on a daily basis during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"You can follow these 10 steps to keep healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic.Keep to your regular routines as much as possible and maintain a daily schedule for yourself including sleeping, meals and activities. Stay socially connected. Speak to loved ones and people you trust every day or as much as possible, using the telephone, video-calls or messaging, through writing letters, etc. Use this time to share your feelings and to do common hobbies together. Be physically active every day. Reduce long periods of sitting and set up a daily routine that includes at least 30 minutes of exercise. Make sure to do activities that are safe and appropriate for your level of physical fitness as indicated by your health-care worker. You can use household chores as a way to keep physically active, follow an on-line class (e.g. Tai Chi, yoga) or choose your favourite music and dance to that. Drink water and eat healthy and well-balanced meals. This will keep you hydrated, help strengthen your immune system and lower the risk of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases. For nutrition advice click here. Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 because smoking can affect lung capacity and because the act of smoking increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand to mouth. Drinking alcohol not only disturbs your sleep but may also increase your risk of falls, weaken your immune system, and interact with any prescription medicines that you are taking. Limit the amount of alcohol you drink or dont drink alcohol at all. Take breaks from news coverage about COVID-19 as prolonged exposure can cause feelings of anxiety and despair. Seek updates at specific times of the day from a reliable source like the WHO website or national or local channels in order to help you distinguish facts from rumours or scams. Engage in hobbies and activities that you enjoy or learn something new. Cognitive exercise such as reading a book or doing crosswords/Sudoku will keep your mind active and distract you from worrying. You can also use this time to keep a well-being diary. If you have ongoing health conditions, take your prescribed medicines and follow the advice of your health-care worker regarding any health visits or phone consultations. If you have an emergency medical condition that is not related to COVID-19, contact health emergencies immediately and ask what you should do next. Follow the instructions of the health-care worker. If stress, worry, fear or sadness get in the way of your daily activities for several days in a row, seek psychosocial support from available services in your community. If you are subject to abuse or violence from others, tell someone you trust and report this to the relevant authorities. You can also seek support from dedicated helplines that may be available in your country.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What should I do if I have symptoms of COVID-19?,"If you present symptoms related to COVID-19, seek medical advice. Call by phone first if possible and give information about pre-existing health conditions and medicines that you are taking. Follow the instructions of the health-care worker and monitor your symptoms regularly. If you have difficulty breathing, contact health emergencies immediately as this may be due to a respiratory infection. Call by phone first if possible to learn what to do next.If you live with others, make sure that you isolate yourself as soon as you suspect infectionby using the space that you identified in advance. You and other members of the household should also wear a medical mask as much as possible if these are available. You can learn how to wear a mask here.If you live with others and home care for COVID-19 is advised by your health-care worker, other household members should follow available guidance on home care for patients with COVID-19 presenting with mild symptoms and management of their contacts (guidance here). See related flyers for people who are ill, for household members and for caregivers.If you live alone and home care for COVID-10 is advised by your health-care worker, ask your family, friends, neighbours, health-care worker or a local volunteer organisation to check in on you regularly and to provide support as needed following existing guidance for caregivers (guidance here).",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
I have recently lost someone I care about. What advice do you have to help me cope?,"Losing someone close to you is always hard, whatever the cause. During these extraordinary circumstances, when your usual routine may be disrupted and when funerals may not be permitted, it may be even harder. Following this advice may help. Do not criticise yourself for how you feel. When you lose a family member or friend to COVID-19, you may experience a range of emotions. You may also have difficulty sleeping or low levels of energy. All these feelings are normal and there is no right or wrong way to feel grief.Allow yourself time to process your emotions in response to your loss. You may think that the sadness and pain that you feel will never go away, but in most cases, these feelings lessen over time.Talk regularly with people that you trust about your feelings.Keep to your routines as much as you feel able and try to focus on activities that bring you joy.Seek advice and comfort from people that you trust (e.g. religious/faith leaders, mental health workers or other trusted members of your community) while maintaining physical distance (e.g. attending virtual mass). Think of alternative ways to say goodbye to the person who passed away such as writing a letter or dedicating a drawing to your loved one.

Are children at lower risk of COVID-19 than adults?,"So far, data suggests that children under the age of 18 years represent about 8.5% of reported cases, with relatively few deaths compared to other age groups and usually mild disease. However, cases of critical illness have been reported. As with adults, pre-existing medical conditions have been suggested as a risk factor for severe disease and intensive care admission in children.Further studies are underway to assess the risk of infection in children and to better understand transmission in this age group.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is the role of children in transmission?,"The role of children in transmission is not yet fully understood. To date, few outbreaks involving children or schools have been reported. However, the small number of outbreaks reported among teaching or associated staff to date suggests that spread of COVID-19 within educational settings may be limited.As children generally have milder illness and fewer symptoms, cases may sometimes go unnoticed. Importantly, early data from studies suggest that infection rates among teenagers may be higher than in younger children.Considering that many countries are starting to slowly lift restrictions on activities, the longer-term effects of keeping schools open on community transmission are yet to be evaluated. Some modelling studies suggest that school re-opening might have a small effect on wider transmission in the community, but this is not well understood. Further studies are underway on the role of children in transmission in and outside of educational settings. WHO is collaborating with scientists around the world to develop protocols that countries can use to study COVID-19 transmission in educational institutions.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"Should children with underlying health conditions (asthma, diabetes, obesity) return to school?","Whether a child should go to school depends on their health condition, the current transmission of COVID-19 within their community, and the protective measures the school and community have in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. While current evidence suggests that the risk of severe disease for children is lower overall than for adults, special precautions can be taken to minimize the risk of infection among children, and the benefits of returning to school should also be considered.Current evidence suggests that people with underlying conditions such as chronic respiratory illness including asthma (moderate-to-severe), obesity, diabetes or cancer, are at higher risk of developing severe disease and death than people without other health conditions. This also appears to be the case for children, but more information is still needed.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should teachers and other staff with underlying health conditions return to school?,"Adults 60 years and older and people with underlying health conditions are at higher risk for severe disease and death.

What are the prevention and control measures to be prepared and put in place in schools?,"There are several actions and requirements that should be reviewed and put in place to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in schools and into the community; and to ensure the safety of children and school staff while at school. Special provisions should be considered for early childhood development, higher learning institutions, residential schools or specialized institutions.WHO recommends the following:Community-level measures: Carry out early detection, testing, contact tracing and quarantine of contacts; investigate clusters; ensure physical distancing, hand and hygiene practices and age-appropriate mask use; shield vulnerable groups. Community-led initiatives such as addressing misleading rumors also play an important role in reducing the risk of infection.Policy, practice and infrastructure: Ensure the necessary resources, policies and infrastructure, are in place that protect the health and safety of all school personnel, including people at higher risk.Behavioral aspects: Consider the age and capacity of students to understand and respect measures put in place. Younger children may find it more difficult to adhere to physical distancing or the appropriate use of masks.Safety and security: School closure or re-opening may affect the safety and security of students and the most vulnerable children may require special attention, such as during pick-up and drop-off.Hygiene and daily practices at the school and classroom level: Physical distancing of at least 1 metre between individuals including spacing of desks, frequent hand and respiratory hygiene, age-appropriate mask use, ventilation and environmental cleaning measures should be in place to limit exposure. Schools should educate staff and students on COVID-19 prevention measures, develop a schedule for daily cleaning and disinfection of the school environment, facilities and frequently touches surfaces, and ensure availability of hand hygiene facilities and national/local guidance on the use of masks.Screening and care of sick students, teachers and other school staff: Schools should enforce the policy of staying home if unwellÂ, waive the requirement for a doctors note, create a checklist for parents/students/staff to decide whether to go to school (taking into consideration the local situation), ensure students who have been in contact with a COVID-19 case stay home for 14 days, and consider options for screening on arrival.Protection of individuals at high-risk: Schools should identify students and teachers at high-risk with pre-existing medical conditions to come up with strategies to keep them safe; maintain physical distancing and se of medical masks as well as frequent hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.Communication with parents and students: Schools should keep students and parents informed about the measures being implemented to ensure their collaboration and support.Additional school-related measures such as immunization checks and catch-up vaccination programmes: Ensure continuity or expansion of essential services, including school feeding and mental health and psycho-social support.Physical distancing outside classrooms: Maintain a distance of at least 1 metre for both students (all age groups) and staff, where feasible.Physical distancing inside classrooms:In areas with community transmission of COVID-19, maintain a distance of at least 1 metre between all individuals of all age groups, for any schools remaining open. This includes increasing desk spacing and staging recesses, breaks and lunchbreaks; limiting the mixing of classes and of age groups; considering smaller classes or alternating attendance schedules, and ensuring good ventilation in classrooms.In areas with cluster-transmission of COVID-19, a risk-based approach should be taken when deciding whether to keep a distance of at least 1 metre between students. Staff should always keep at least 1 metre apart from each other and from students and should wear a mask in situations where 1-metre distance is not practical.In areas with sporadic cases/no cases of COVID-19, children under the age of 12 should not be required to keep physical distance at all times. Where feasible, children aged 12 and over should keep at least 1 metre apart from each other. Staff should always keep at least 1 metre from each other and from students and should wear a mask in situations where 1-metre distance is not practical. Remote learning: Where children cannot attend classes in person, support should be given to ensure students have continued access to educational materials and technologies (internet, texting radio, radio, or television), (e.g. delivering assignments or broadcasting lessons). Shutting down educational facilities should only be considered when no alternatives are available.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What are the risks during transportation to and from schools?,"The following adaptations to transport to and from school should be implemented to limit unnecessary exposure of school or staff members.Promote and put in place respiratory and hand hygiene, physical distancing measures and use of masks in transportation such as school buses, in accordance with local policy.Provide tips for how to safely commute to and from school, including for public transportation.Organize only one child per seat and ensure physical distancing of at least 1 metre between passengers in school buses, if possible.

Teacher and support staff may be required to wear masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others or there is widespread transmission in the area.Types of mask:Fabric masksare recommended to prevent onward transmission in the general population in public areas, particularly where distancing is not possible, and in areas of community transmission.This could include the school grounds in some situations. Masks may help to protect others,because wearers may be infected before symptoms of illness appear. The policy on wearing a mask or face covering should be in line with national or local guidelines.Where used, masks should be worn, cared for and disposed of properly.The use of masks by children and adolescents in schools should only be considered as one part of a strategy to limit the spread of COVID-19.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Are there any specific recommendations on school ventilation and air conditioning use?,"Yes, ensure adequate ventilation and increase total airflow supply to occupied spaces, if possible. Clean, natural ventilation (i.e., opening windows) should be used inside buildings where possible, without re-circulating the air. If heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems are used they should be regularly inspected, maintained and cleaned. Rigorous standards for installation, maintenance and filtration are essential to make sure they are effective and safe. Consider running the systems at maximum outside airflow for two hours before and after times when the building is occupied, according to the manufacturers recommendations.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What should be monitored after re-opening of school?,"The following should be monitored:effectiveness of symptoms-reporting, monitoring, rapid testing and tracing of suspected casesthe effects of policies and measures on educational objectives and learning outcomesthe effects of policies and measures on health and well-being of children, siblings, staff, parents and other family membersthe trend in school dropouts after lifting the restrictionsthe number of cases in children and staff in the school, and frequency of school-based outbreaks in the local administrative area and the country.Assessment of impact of remote teaching on learning outcomes.Based on what is learned from this monitoring, further modifications should be made to continue to provide children and staff with the safest environment possible.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is self care?,"WHOs definition of self care is the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain health, and to cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a health worker.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What are self-care interventions?,"Self-care interventions recommended by WHO are evidence-based and can include information about a sexual or reproductive health issue as well as ways in which individuals can obtain drugs, devices, diagnostics and/or digital products fully or partially separate from formal health services that can be used with or without the direct supervision of a health worker. For example, self-injectable contraception, HPV self-sampling kits or HIV self-tests.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Why are self-care interventions important during a pandemic like COVID-19?,"With the major disruptions to the normal functioning of national health systems caused by the need to respond to people who have or are affected by the virus, evidence-based, high-quality self-care interventions can provide an important alternative to the usual health facility- or health worker-based services. Self-care is a valuable part of a well-functioning health system and can be particularly useful when physical distancing measures make it more difficult for people to access their normal health care services and medications.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Do I need to see a health worker for self care actions?,"Self-care interventions provide individuals, families and communities with a way to manage their own health at home. Some self-care actions, such as washing your hands and practicing good respiratory hygiene measures that protect you from COVID-19, do not need you to meet with a health worker. Other self-care interventions, such as obtaining a prescription for hormonal contraception and abortion medications or counselling during pregnancy, will need interaction with a health worker. Such support can be provided in different ways during this pandemic and will depend on the healthcare arrangements in place where you live; for example, some medicines are available over-the-counter without a prescription in a pharmacy, or counseling and important information during pregnancy and when caring for a newborn can be provided over the phone or online.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What self care actions can I take to protect my sexual and reproductive health?,"In 2019, WHO issued a new guideline that brought together 32 existing or new recommendations on a range of sexual and reproductive health self-care interventions. The guideline has recommendations on pregnancy and newborn care, contraception, abortion, sexually transmitted infections including HIV and HPV, and for sexual health more broadly. ",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How can I get healthcare support during the COVID-19 pandemic for a self-care intervention?,"There are a number of ways in which support can be provided: Digital technologies and platforms, such as helplines through the phone or online or websites of organizations with recognized expertise may be available for consultation or follow up. Such information sources could enable you to then proceed with obtaining and self-administering an injectable contraceptive or self-testing for HIV, for example. It may also be possible to get over the counter medical devices, medicines, information and diagnostics through pharmacies or drug stores. Menstrual hygiene products, pregnancy tests, condoms and emergency contraception pills are usually available over-the-counter and depending on where you live, contraceptive pills and drugs that protect you from getting HIV if you think you have been exposed to risk. You may also be able to receive communications in a variety of ways that can help keep you healthy. Examples include notifications and reminders about taking medicines sent by SMS or email.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Is self care safe?,"For all of the recommendations on self-care interventions on sexual and reproductive health issued by WHO, the evidence to date suggests that self care is safe, with the right level of support by the health service as needed. Self-care can also benefit health workers, by allowing them to serve a greater number of patients and deploying their clinical skills where greatest need exists. During a pandemic such as COVID-19, adopting self-care as part of the healthcare system can also reduce the exposure of health workers to infection as self-care will reduce the number of in-person contacts with a health worker.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Who is self care for?,"Self care can be practiced by everyone and evidence-based self-care interventions have the potential to benefit even the most vulnerable populations. For individuals who may need to access information, counselling or a health services before, during or after accessing a self-care intervention, links with existing health services remains important. Examples of providing access to referrals and health facilities for non-COVID-19 related SRH conditions may include ensuring antenatal care visits, delivery and postpartum care; retesting and HIV treatment if an individuals HIV self-test is positive along with other STI diagnostic and treatment as required. In addition, crisis centers, shelters, legal aid, and protection services for individuals subject to violence.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is serology?,"Serology is the study of antibodies in blood serum. Antibodies are part of the bodys immune response to infection. Antibodies that work against SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID-19 are usually detectable in the first few weeks after infection. The presence of antibodies indicates that a person was infected with SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of whether the individual had severe or mild disease, or no symptoms. Seroprevalence studies are conducted to measure the extent of infection, as measured by antibody levels, in a population under study. With any new virus, including SARS-CoV-2, initial seroprevalence in the population is assumed to be low or non-existent due to the fact that the virus has not circulated before.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is the difference between molecular testing and serologic testing?,"Molecular testing, including polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) testing, detects genetic material of the virus and so can detect if a person is currently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Serologic testing detects antibodies against a virus, measuring the amount of antibodies produced following infection, thereby detecting if a person has previously been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Serologic tests should not be used to diagnose acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, as antibodies develop a few weeks after infection.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is the purpose of serologic testing?,"When a new disease, like COVID-19 emerges, initial surveillance and testing strategies focus initially on patients with severe disease and the use of molecular testing to measure acute infections, as these are the individuals who seek and require health care. This can often miss the fraction of mild or asymptomatic infections that do not require medical attention, and as such, the full extent of infection is not known early in an outbreak. Serologic testing helps retrospectively determine the size of an outbreak or extent of infection in a population under study. Seroprevalence studies give a more complete picture of how much of a population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and will capture unrecognized cases not identified through routine or active surveillance.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Does the presence of antibodies mean that a person is immune?,"There are many studies underway to better understand the antibody response following infection to SARS-CoV-2. Several studies to date show that most people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop antibodies specific to this virus. However, the levels of these antibodies can vary between those who have severe disease (higher levels of antibodies) and those with milder disease or asymptomatic infection (lower levels of antibodies). Many studies are underway to better understand the levels of antibodies that are needed for protection, and how long these antibodies last.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can people who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection be re-infected?,"To date, there are some reports of individuals who have been reinfected with SARS-CoV-2. There are likely to be more examples of reinfection reported and scientists are working to understand the role of the immune response in the first and second infection. WHO is working with scientists to understand each occurrence of reinfection and the antibody response during the first and subsequent infections.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What are the results of seroprevalence studies published to date?,"There are now more than 200 peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints, manuscripts and government reports of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies. These studies vary in study design, populations under study, serologic tests used, timing of sample collection, and quality. Overall, the population-based seroprevalence reported across available studies remains low, at below 10%. Some studies conducted in areas of known high virus transmission and studies of health care workers in areas of known high transmission have reported seroprevalence estimates over 20%. Available study results indicate that, globally, most people remain susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is herd immunity?,"Herd immunity', also known as 'population immunity', is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection. WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through any segment of the population,as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths.Herd immunityagainst COVID-19 should beachieved by protecting peoplethrough vaccination,not by exposing them to the pathogen that causes the disease.Read the Director-Generals12 October media briefing speechfor more detail.Vaccines train our immune systems to create proteins that fight disease, known as antibodies, just as would happen when we are exposed to a disease but crucially vaccines work without making us sick. Vaccinated people are protected from getting the disease in question and passing onthepathogen, breaking any chains of transmission.Visit ourwebpageon COVID-19 and vaccines for more detail.To safely achieveherd immunityagainst COVID-19, a substantial proportion of a populationwould need to bevaccinated, lowering the overall amount of virusable to spreadin the whole population.One of the aims with working towards herd immunity is to keepvulnerable groups who cannot get vaccinated(e.g. due to health conditions like allergic reactions to the vaccine) safeand protectedfrom the disease. The percentage of people who need tobe immunein order to achieve herd immunityvaries with each disease. For example, herd immunity against measles requires about 95% of a population to be vaccinated. The remaining 5% will be protected by the fact that measles will not spread among those who are vaccinated. For polio, the threshold is about 80%.The proportion of the population that must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to begin inducing herd immunity is not known.This is an important area of research and will likely vary according to the community, the vaccine, the populations prioritized for vaccination, and other factors.Achieving herd immunity with safe and effective vaccines makes diseases rarer and saves lives.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses similar?,"Firstly, COVID-19 and influenza viruses have a similar disease presentation. That is, they both cause respiratory disease, which presents as a wide range of illness from asymptomatic or mild through to severe disease and death. Secondly, both viruses are transmitted by contact, droplets and fomites. As a result, the same public health measures, such as hand hygiene and good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue), are important actions all can take to prevent infection.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?,"The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19. Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmissiontransmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission. The reproductive number the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult. Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa. While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection. Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection. Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What medical interventions are available for COVID-19 and influenza viruses?,"While there are a number of therapeutics currently in clinical trials in China and more than 20 vaccines in development for COVID-19, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19. In contrast, antivirals and vaccines available for influenza. While the influenza vaccine is not effective against COVID-19 virus, it is highly recommended to get vaccinated each year to prevent influenza infection.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021

So how do I stay safe while exercising in COVID-19?,"Do not exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Stay home and rest, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.If you are able to go for a walk or bicycle ride always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home. If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. If you go to a park or public open space to walk, run or exercise always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap, before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home. If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. Follow the directions of your local health authority in regards to any restrictions on the number of people with you and/or restrictions on the use of public outdoor play or exercise equipment. If you are not regularly active start slowly and with low intensity activities, like walking and low impact exercises. Start with shorter amounts, like 5-10 minutes, and gradually build up to 30 minutes or more continuously over a few weeks. It is better and safer to be active for short periods more frequently than to try and be active for long periods when you are not used to it. Choose the right activity so that you reduce the risk of injury and that you enjoy the activity. Choose the right intensity according to your health status and fitness level. You should be able to breath comfortably and hold a conversation while you do light- and moderate-intensity physical activity.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How do I stay active in and around the home?,"Try and reduce long periods of time spent sitting, whether for work, studying, watching TV, reading, or using social media or playing games using screens. Reduce sitting for long periods by taking short 3-5 minute breaks every 20-30 minutes. Simply stand up and stretch or even better, take a walk around the house, up and down the stairs, or into the garden. By just moving around and stretching you can improve your health and wellbeing.

Are there precautions to take while eating in a restaurant?,"There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is transmitted by food, including fresh fruits and vegetables. The virus can be killed while cooking food at temperatures of at least 70Â°C.Food buffets are not recommended because of the risk of close physical contact with others, shared serving implements and multiple people touching the surfaces on the buffet. Indoor dining spaces should have a maximum of 4 people in 10 square metres. The distance from the back of one chair to the back of another chair should be at least 1 metre apart for both indoor and outdoor dining, and guests that face each other should also be at this distance.Guests should be reminded when entering and leaving the area to clean their hands. When the physical distance of at least 1 metre cannot be guaranteed, masks are recommended to be worn by staff and guests.

Is it safe to use fans or air conditioning in an accommodation?,"Ventilation is an important factor in preventing the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading. Recirculated air from split air conditioning units, fan coils or any system that runs with a recirculation mode should be avoided where possible, unless in a single occupancy room with no one else present. If recirculation is unavoidable, increase outdoor air exchange by opening windows, if possible and safe to do so, and minimize air blowing from one person directly at another. Floor or ceiling fans can provide ventilation when the people occupying the room are from the same household, but are not recommended when travelers from different households are together.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can you get the virus from people who were in the room previous to you?,"Hotels and other accommodations should have procedures for cleaning, disinfecting and ventilating the room properly between every guests stay.

What should travelers do if they get sick while at an accommodation facility?,"If a guest develops symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, dry cough or tiredness, they should notify the facility manager and seek medical advice by contacting local health authorities. The guest should isolate from others, including fellow travelers. If the guest cannot be isolated or staff need to enter the room, the ill person should put on a medical mask, and people nearby should also wear a mask. If the medical mask cannot be tolerated by the ill person, then he or she should cough or sneeze into a bent elbow or use tissues to cover the mouth, and discard the tissue immediately into a closed waste bag.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"As a smoker, is my risk of getting the COVID-19 virus higher than that of a non-smoker?","At the time of preparing this Q&A, there are no peer-reviewed studies that have evaluated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with smoking. However, tobacco smokers (cigarettes, waterpipes, bidis, cigars, heated tobacco products) may be more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19, as the act of smoking involves contact of fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) with the lips, which increases the possibility of transmission of viruses from hand to mouth. Smoking waterpipes, also known as shisha or hookah, often involves the sharing of mouth pieces and hoses, which could facilitate the transmission of the COVID-19 virus in communal and social settings.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Does nicotine use affect my chances in the context of COVID-19?,"There is currently insufficient information to confirm any link between tobacco or nicotine in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.

"If I feel well but am in the high-risk category, should I travel?","People age 60 and over, and those with serious chronic diseases of underlying health conditions, should postpone or delay travel internationally to and from areas with community transmission, where there are many cases of COVID-19. This is because people in the high-risk group more frequently get very sick after getting the disease, with some dying of it. If you have to travel in these circumstances, you should wear a medical mask for more protection against the virus. However, masks do not mean you are fully protected. You should also clean your hands frequently, cough or sneeze into a bent elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 metre from others wherever possible.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How can ventilation reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 in airplanes?,"Some airplanes have cabin air filtration systems equipped with HEPA filters which can remove viruses and germs quickly, minimizing the duration of the exposure to any potential infectious materials produced by a cough or sneeze. The cabin air system is designed to operate most efficiently by delivering approximately 50 percent outside air and 50 percent filtered, recirculated air. The air supply is essentially sterile and particle-free. However, adequate ventilation is just one of the preventive measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Other important measures include maintaining physical distance of at least 1 meter whenever possible, frequent hand hygiene and wearing a mask. Passengers should check with the airline company and the national or local guidelines about when and where to wear a mask while flying.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
The travel company is asking me to wear a mask while traveling. Which kind of mask should I use?,"You should follow the advice of your travel company. If the type of mask is not specified then people 60 years and over, and those who have underlying health conditions, should wear a medical mask while traveling. This provides greater protection from others who may have the virus.People who feel healthy and have no symptoms can wear a fabric mask to prevent any virus they may have from spreading to others. Remember that wearing a mask does not provide full protection. You should always combine this with frequent hand cleaning, covering a cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue, and maintaining at least a 1 metre distance from others wherever possible.Find out how to choose and wear a mask here.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should I get an immunity certificate before travelling?,"The use of immunity certificatesÂ for international travel in the context of COVID-19 is not currently supported by scientific evidence and therefore not recommended by WHO. More evidence is needed to understand the effectiveness of rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests. For more information, please refer to WHO scientific brief Immunity passports in the context of COVID-19, which will be updated as new evidence becomes available. Beyond the scientific considerations, there are ethical, legal and human rights aspects related to privacy of personal data, medical confidentiality, potential risk of falsification or engagement in risky behaviour, stigma and discrimination.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Could I be screened when I exit or arrive at my destination?,"Whether screening is conducted depends on the country policies and its risk benefit analysis. Exit and entry screening includes measures like temperature checking and checking for signs and symptoms (fever above 38Â°C, cough). You may be asked to complete a form informing health authorities about your possible exposure to cases within the last two weeks (contact with patients among health care workers, visits to hospitals, sharing accommodation with a person sick with COVID-19, etc.). Symptomatic travellers and identified contacts will be asked to have a medical examination and be tested for COVID- 19. You should not be charged for these protective measures, including any required isolation and quarantine.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should I use a digital contact tracing app while traveling?,Digital apps are now available in some countries to identify and inform travellers who may have been in contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19 or had a positive test for COVID-19. They are effective only if a large proportion of the general population uses the app. International travellers may have issues of compatibility and data sharing when crossing borders. Those considering an app are advised to review the legal and ethical aspects related to individual privacy and personal data protection.,World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should I get a test before departure or upon arrival?,"Laboratory PCR testing (molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2) immediately prior to departure or on arrival may provide information about the status of travellers. However, laboratory results should be interpreted with caution, since a small proportion of false negative and false positive results may occur. If conducted, testing should be accompanied by a comprehensive COVID-19 follow up, for example, by advising departing travellers who have been tested to report any symptoms to local public health authorities. If the testing is conducted on arrival, all travellers should be provided with an emergency phone number in case symptoms develop. A relevant case management protocol should be followed in case of a positive test.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What happens if I have symptoms when arriving at my destination?,"If you have any symptoms or have had contact with people who have COVID-19, you may be asked to get an exam and be tested for COVID-19. Even if you dont test positive, you should be provided with an emergency phone number to call in case symptoms develop later. You should not be charged by the country for:examinations to determine your health statusrequired vaccinations or protective equipment on arrival (if these were not published at least 10 days earlier)appropriate isolation or quarantine facilitiesrequired certificates at the point of entry that document measures applied any baggage accompanying you",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What should I do after arriving at my destination?,"Travellers should self-monitor for any symptoms for 14 days after arrival. Report any symptoms and your travel history to local health facilities and follow national protocols. If you are confirmed to have COVID-19, you will be placed in isolation in a health facility or in self-isolation at home, depending on the countrys policies, and asked to provide a list of your contacts in the last 14 days. Your contacts will be placed under quarantine.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021

"Are people with tuberculosis likely to be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, illness and death?","While experience on COVID-19 infection in tuberculosis (TB) patients remains limited, it is anticipated that people ill with both TB and COVID-19 may have poorer treatment outcomes, especially if TB treatment is interrupted. Older age, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are linked with more severe COVID-19 and are also risk factors for poor outcomes in TB.TB patients should take precautions as advised by health authorities to be protected from COVID-19 and continue their TB treatment as prescribed.People ill with COVID-19 and TB show similar symptoms such as cough, fever and difficulty breathing. Both diseases attack primarily the lungs and although both biological agents transmit mainly via close contact, the incubation period from exposure to disease in TB is longer, often with a slow onset.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Do COVID-19 and tuberculosis spread in the same way?,"While both tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 spread by close contact between people the exact mode of transmission differs, explaining some differences in infection control measures to mitigate the two conditions. TB bacilli remain suspended in the air in droplet nuclei for several hours after a TB patient coughs, sneezes, shouts, or sings, and people who inhale them can get infected. The size of these droplet nuclei is a key factor determining their infectiousness. Their concentration decreases with ventilation and exposure to direct sunlight. COVID-19 transmission has primarily been attributed to the direct breathing of droplets expelled by someone with COVID-19 (people may be infectious before clinical features become apparent). Droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, exhaling and speaking may land on objects and surfaces, and contacts can get infected with COVID-19 by touching them and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth . Handwashing, in addition to respiratory precautions, are thus important in the control of COVID-19.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Does the BCG vaccine protect people from COVID-19?,"There is no evidence at this point that the Bacille Calmette-Gurin vaccine (BCG) protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus. Clinical trials addressing this question are underway, and WHO will evaluate the evidence when it is available. In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. WHO continues to recommendreserving BCG for neonatal vaccination in settings with a high risk of tuberculosis.More information",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is ventilation and how can it prevent COVID-19 from spreading?,"Ventilation involves introducing clean air into a space while removing stale air, in order to maintain or improve air quality. Ventilation can be achieved naturally (e.g. by opening a window) or by installing a mechanical system. The spread of COVID-19 occurs most often when an infected person is in close or direct contact with another person. The risk of the spread of the virus is higher in crowded and poorly ventilated spaces where people spend long periods of time together in close proximity. Improving indoor ventilation can reduce the risk of the virus spreading indoors. Ventilation is not a standalone measure and it should be implemented as part of a comprehensive package of measures, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, frequent hand cleaning, and coughing or sneezing into a bent elbow. Each of these is important to protect you against COVID-19 infection. ",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How do I naturally ventilate a room?,"When you are inside with other people, open windows or doors whenever possible. For instance, try to get a cross breeze so that air coming in from one window moves across the room and exits from another window.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can I use air conditioning or other ventilation systems?,"Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are used to maintain indoor air temperature and humidity at healthy and comfortable levels. A well-maintained and operated system can reduce the spread of COVID-19 in indoor spaces by increasing the rate of air change, reducing air recirculation and increasing the amount of outdoor air coming in. Settings that recirculate the air should not be used. HVAC systems should always be regularly inspected, maintained, and cleaned.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How can I improve heating and air conditioning systems at home?,"Non-ducted heating and air conditioning units that recirculate air, such as fan-coil or split units, should be assessed, maintained and cleaned according to manufacturer recommendations. Assess the units filter and consider replacing the existing filter with MERV14/F8 or the highest compatible filter with the filter rack, in collaboration with an HVAC professional. The units and filters should be periodically cleaned and maintained according to manufacturer recommendations.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can fans be used safely inside?,"Air blowing from an infected person directly at another person in a closed space increases the risk of the virus spreading from one person to another.If COVID-19 is circulating in your community and the use of a table or pedestal fan is unavoidable, it is important to regularly bring in air from outside by opening windows or doors, while minimizing how much air blows from one person (or group of people) to another person (or group of people).The use of ceiling fans can improve the circulation of air from outside and avoid pockets of stagnant air forming indoors. However, it is critical to bring in air from outside when using ceiling fans, such as by opening windows.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How can I improve ventilation at home if someone is sick and isolating there?,"If someone is sick and being cared for at home, here are some precautions to take:The ill person should stay in a separate room. If this is not possible, then keep at least a 1-metre distance from them. The sick person and anyone else in the same room should wear a medical mask.Provide good ventilation in the room of the ill person and shared spaces, and open windows if possible and safe to do so. Use cross ventilation to increase natural air movement by opening windows or doors on both sides of the room. If possible, block air from moving from the sick persons room to the rest of the house. If available, choose a room with a private toilet with an air extractor or exhaust fan, which should run at a high speed.As a supplement, you can use a stand-alone air cleaner with a MERV14/F8 filter. These devices may improve air quality but are not a replacement for ventilation.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
How can ventilation reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 in airplanes?,"Most airplanes have cabin air filtration systems equipped with HEPA filters which can remove viruses and germs quickly, minimizing how long people are exposed to any potential infectious virus or bacteria expelled by a cough or sneeze. Cabin air systems are designed to operate most efficiently by delivering approximately 50 percent outside air and 50 percent filtered, recirculated air. The air supply is essentially sterile and particle-free. However, adequate ventilation is just one of the preventive measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Other important measures include maintaining physical distance of at least 1 metre whenever possible, wearing a mask, frequent hand hygiene and wearing a mask.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can the use of air conditioning increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in health facilities?,"Some health facilities may use heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to maintain indoor air temperature and humidity at healthy and comfortable levels for staff, patients and visitors. A well-maintained and operated system may reduce the risk of transmission in indoor spaces by increasing the rate of air change, reducing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air.HVAC systems should be regularly inspected, maintained, and cleaned. Rigorous standards for installation and maintenance of ventilation systems are essential to ensure that they are effective and contribute to a safe environment within the health facility as a whole.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Can fans be used in health facilities?,"In health facilities, use of desk or pedestal fans for air circulation should be avoided if possible unless it is in a single occupancy room when there are no visitors or staff present. If the use of desk or pedestal fans is unavoidable, ensure that the fan is directed away from the corridor or any area where people may pass by since the unfiltered air could potentially expose a passerby to the COVID-19 virus. In addition, outdoor air exchange should be increased by opening windows when fans are used.The use of ceiling fans can improve circulation of outside air and avoid pockets of stagnant air in occupied space. However, it is critical to maintain good outdoor ventilation when using ceiling fans. An efficient way to increase outdoor air exchange is by opening windows. However, doors should be closed to avoid air from COVID-19 patient rooms to other areas in the health facility.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What medical procedures are considered aerosol generating in health facilities?,"Some medical procedures can generate infectious aerosols and have been associated with a higher risk of transmission of coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2). Although there is no comprehensive list of aerosol-generating procedures, current data suggest that the following procedures can generate infectious aerosols:tracheal intubationnon-invasive ventilationtracheotomycardiopulmonary resuscitationmanual ventilation before intubationsputum inductionbronchoscopyautopsy proceduresdental procedures that use spray-generating equipmentIt is not yet known whether aerosols generated by nebulizer therapy or high-flow oxygen delivery are infectious, as data on this is still limited.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What does it mean to say a virus mutates or changes?,"When a virus replicates or makes copies of itself, it sometimes changes a little bit. These changes are called mutations.Â A virus with one or several new mutations is referred to as a variantÂ of the original virus.The more viruses circulate, the more they may change. These changes can occasionally result in a virus variant that is better adapted to its environment compared to the original virus. This process of changing and selection of successful variants is called virus evolution.ÂSome mutations can lead to changes in a viruss characteristics, such as altered transmission (for example, it may spread more easily) or severity (for example, it may cause more severe disease).Some viruses change quickly and others more slowly. SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, tends to change more slowly than others such as HIV or influenza viruses. This could in part be explained by the viruss internal proofreading mechanismÂ which can correct mistakesÂ when it makes copies of itself. Scientists continue to study this mechanism to better understand how it works.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should I be concerned about SARS-CoV-2 changing?,"It is normal for viruses to change, but it is still something scientists follow closely because there can be important implications. All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, change over time. So far hundreds of variations of this virus have been identified worldwide. WHO and partners have been following them closely since January 2020. Most changes have little to no impact on the virus properties. However, depending on where the changes are located in the viruss genetic material, they may affect the viruss properties, such as transmission (for example, it may spread more easily) or severity (for example, it may cause more severe disease). WHO and its international network of experts, are monitoring changes to the virus so that if significant mutations are identified, WHO can report any modifications to interventions needed by countries and individuals to prevent the spread of that variant. The current strategies and measures recommended by WHO continue to work against virus variants identified since the start of the pandemic. See WHOs Disease Outbreak News for reports on variants. The best way to limit and suppress the transmission of COVID-19 is for people to continue taking the necessary precautions to keep themselves and others safe.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What is WHO doing to monitor and understand the changes in SARS-CoV-2?,"Since the start of the outbreak, WHO has been working with a global network of expert laboratories around the world to support testing and better understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.Research groups have sequenced SARS-CoV-2 and shared these on public databases, includingGISAID. This global collaboration allows scientists to better track the virus and how it is changing.WHOs global SARS-CoV-2 laboratory network includes a dedicated SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group, which aims to detect new mutations quickly and assess their possible impact.WHO recommends that all countries increase the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses where possible and share sequence data internationally to help one another monitor and respond to the evolving pandemic.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
"How does SARS-CoV-2 change when it infects animals, and what are the implications?","SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily through human-to-human transmission, but there is evidence of transmission between humans and animals. Several animals like mink, dogs, domestic cats, lions,tigers and raccoon dogs have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after contact with infected humans.There have been reports of large animal outbreaks in mink farms in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 can change while infecting minks. It has been observed that these mink variants are able to transmit back into humans through close contact with the mink. Preliminary results suggest that the mink variants infecting humans appear to have the same properties as other variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Further research is needed to better understand whether these mink variants will cause sustained transmission among humans and could have a negative impact on countermeasures, such as vaccines.See WHOs Disease Outbreak News on DenmarkWHO works closely with other organizations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the World Organisation for Animal Health, to evaluate situations of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and transmission occurring between animals and humans.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What can staff do to stay safe while working at a hotel or other accommodation establishment?,"Everyone should follow basic precautions: Wash all parts of your hands frequently (at least 20 seconds if using an alcohol-based hand rub, and at least 40 seconds with soap and water), including after exchanging objects such as money or credit cards with guests.Cover a cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue and throw away the tissue in a closed bin.Maintain at least a 1 metre distance from other staff and guests. This includes avoid hugging, kissing, or shaking hands. If you cant guarantee the distance, wear a fabric mask. Be sure to check local and national guidelines on the use of masks. Staying behind plexiglass boards at reception and concierge desks can prevent droplet transmission. Teleworking may be a possibility for some jobs, which can help reduce physical contact with others.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
Should staff wear a mask while working?,"In areas where the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating, staff aged 60 or over, or who have any underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung cancer, should wear a medical mask because of their higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19. Staff under the age of 60 and who are in general good health can wear fabric masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1 metre distance from others. This is particularly important for staff who are in close contact or potential close contact with others. Everyone should follow local policies and regulations.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What should staff do if a guest becomes sick at an accommodation establishment?,"If a guest at the accommodation develops symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, dry cough or tiredness, staff at the accommodation establishment should contact the local health authority and follow their instructions. The sick person should be isolated in a room, alone, or at least 1 metre away from others, according to local health authorities instructions. No visitors should be permitted to enter the room occupied by the affected guest. Staff should also move people traveling with the sick person to a different room, if possible. It is usually the relevant public health authority, not the management of the hotel and accommodation establishment, which has the authority to demand sick guests to temporarily remain in their room or to prevent them from receiving visits from other guests. National law will guide the rights of the guests to refuse or not the recommended measures.Staff entering the room of an ill person should maintain at least a 1 metre distance from the ill person, and request that the ill person put on a medical mask. If staff need to assist an ill guest within a 1 metre distance, they should clean their hands before putting on appropriate personal protective equipment (medical mask and eye protection, gloves and isolation gown), and clean their hands after providing assistance. Training should be provided on how to avoid contaminating themselves.",World Health Organization (WHO),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail,3/29/2021
What should staff do if they have symptoms?,"If staff develop COVID-19 symptoms while at work, such as fever, dry cough or tiredness, they should immediately stop working, put on a medical mask and isolate in a suitable room while medical services are notified. Disposable tissues and an appropriate waste bin with a lid should be available in the designated isolation area while waiting for medical assessment or transfer to an assessment facility.If staff develop symptoms while at home, they should stay at home and seek medical attention, following instructions from a health worker that will include a period of time for self-isolation away from others, including family members, according to local guidance.

How can I get tested for a past infection (antibody test) and what does my test mean?,"Antibody tests for COVID-19 are available through healthcare providers and laboratories. Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests and whether you should get one.A positive test result shows you might have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might provide some protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last. Confirmed and suspected cases of reinfection have been reported, but remain rare.You should continue to protect yourself and otherssince you could get infected with the virus again.If you test negative, you might not have ever had COVID-19. Talk with your healthcare provider about your test result and the type of test you took to understand what your result means.Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19.

What is the difference between COVID-19 and seasonal allergies?,"COVID-19 is a contagious respiratory illness caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19). Seasonal allergies triggered by airborne pollen can lead to seasonal allergic rhinitis, which affects the nose and sinuses, and seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, which affects the eyes.COVID-19 and seasonal allergies share many symptoms, but there are some key differences between the two. For example, COVID-19 can cause fever, which is not a common symptom of seasonal allergies. The image below compares symptoms caused by allergies and COVID-19.Because some of the symptoms of COVID-19 and seasonal allergies are similar, it may be difficult to tell the difference between them, and you may need to get a test to confirm your diagnosis508 version*Seasonal allergies do not usually cause shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, unless a person has a respiratory condition such as asthma that can be triggered by exposure to pollen.This is not a complete list of all possible symptoms of COVID-19 or seasonal allergies. Symptoms vary from person to person and range from mild to severe. You can have symptoms of both COVID-19 and seasonal allergies at the same time.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Does having seasonal allergies increase my risk of contracting COVID-19 or having more severe symptoms if I do contract COVID-19?,"There is not enough scientific information at this time to know whether having seasonal allergies puts you at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or having more severe symptoms if you do contract COVID-19. We do know that older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, or heart or lung disease are at higher risk for developing more serious complications when they have COVID-19. ",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Will I be protected from seasonal allergies if I wear a mask?,"CDC recommends wearing masks to slow the spread of COVID-19. Everyone should wear a mask covering unless they are under 2 years of age, have breathing problems, or are unconscious or incapacitated and would need assistance removing a mask. Masks also offer some protection against seasonal allergies because they can prevent some larger particles from being inhaled. However, if you have seasonal allergies, masks should not be your only protection against pollen exposure because smaller particles can still get through the covering and be inhaled.Wash your masks after each use, particularly if you suffer from seasonal allergies, because the covering may carry particles such as pollen. ",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
How can I protect myself from seasonal allergies?,"The best way to protect yourself against seasonal allergies is to reduce your exposure to pollen. During high pollen days:Limit your time outdoors and seek indoor spaces with clean air.Create a cleaner air space at home to protect yourself from outdoor air irritants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Use a portable air cleaner in one or more rooms. Portable air cleaners work best when run continuously with doors and windows closed.Do-it-yourself box fanfiltration units are a low-cost filtration alternative, but they should never be left unattended.Keep your cleaner air space a comfortable temperature by using air conditioners, heat pumps, fans, and window shades.If you have a forced air system in your home, consult a qualified heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) professional about different filters (HEPA or MERV-13 or higher) and settings ( Recirculate Â and On Â rather than Auto Â) that can be used to reduce indoor air irritants.If outdoors, avoid activities that stir up pollen, such as mowing lawns or raking leaves. When you return indoors, take a shower and change your clothes.The EPA website on indoor air and COVID-19and the EPA Guide to Air Cleaners in the Home provide additional information on improving indoor air quality.

How can the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 be slowed during lifeguard training?,"Lifeguard trainers can consider the following steps to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19:Have the virus? Stay home to save lives.Educate instructors, lifeguard students, and others about when they should stay home to isolate (if they have symptoms of COVID-19 or tested positive for COVID-19) or quarantine (if they have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19) and when they can return or reschedule training.Conduct daily health checks (see frequently asked question on screening) or ask instructors, students, and others to conduct self-checks (such as temperature screening or symptom checking), if possible.Conduct health checks safely and respectfully and in accordance with any applicable local, state, territorial, federal, and tribal privacy and confidentiality laws, rules, and regulations.Be smart, stay at least 6 feet apartConduct knowledge training virtually or online, when possible, to limit contact among instructors, students, and others.Teach and reinforce social (physical) distancingduring in-person skills training in and out of the water â maintaining at least 6 feet between people who donât live together.Provide physical cues or guides (such as lane lines in the water or chairs and tables on the deck) and visual cues (such as posted signs or tape on the deck).Limit close contact, particularly face-to-face interactions, between people who donât live together, as recommended by the lifeguarding-certifying organization. Such asAquatic rescueFor practice rescuesHave each student practice rescues on his or her household member instead of another student.For actual rescuesStress the need to keep the number of people involved in rescue and resuscitation to the minimum number needed to provide proper care.Stress the need to 1) perform rescues from the deck (using an extending or throwing device) if conditions allow and 2) if possible, have people on the deck wear cloth masks, when removing victim from the water because social distancing cannot be maintained. If an in-water rescue is needed, minimize exposure to the distressed swimmerâs face without protection, if possible approaching him or her from behind.Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)For practice resuscitationLimit student-to-manikin ratio and student-to-automated external defibrillator (AED) training device ratio to 1:1. Have each student use his or her own breathing barrier when doing rescue breathing on a manikin.For actual resuscitationStress the need for and train with personal protective equipment (PPE) during resuscitation, as recommended by the CPR-certifying organization (such as the American Red Cross), and use a bag-valve mask (BVM) with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. BVM ventilation is best delivered with two rescuers.Wear a mask. Save lives.Teach and reinforce use of cloth masksin public settings when around people you donât live with, particularly when it is difficult to maintain social distancing.Advise people wearing masks to not wear them in the water. Cloth masks can be difficult to breathe through when theyâre wet. This means it is particularly important to maintain social distancing in the water. Plus, wet cloth masks donât slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as dry cloth masks.Cover coughs and sneezesTeach and reinforce covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or use the inside of elbow), throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands.Wash hands oftenTeach and reinforce handwashingwith soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after being in a public place or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if soap and water are not readily available.Clean and then disinfectClean and then disinfect surfaces frequently touched by multiple people (such as door handles, light switches, and tables).

Persons frequently in congregate settings (e.g., homeless shelters, assisted living facilities, college or university dormitories) are at increased risk of acquiring infection because of the increased likelihood of close contact. Those who live in or have recently been to areas with sustained transmission may also be at higher risk of infection. All persons can reduce the risk to themselves and others by wearing a mask, practicing physical distancing, washing their hands often, and taking other prevention measures.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"What should healthcare providers do outside of work to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19?","To prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside of work, healthcare providers should follow CDC's Guidance on Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure and the general guidance at Your Health. Because of their potential for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at work, some healthcare providers may choose to implement extra measures when arriving home from providing healthcare, such as removing any clothing they wore while delivering healthcare, taking off their shoes, washing their clothing, and immediately showering. However, these practices are optional and based on a personal decision; there is insufficient evidence to determine whether these additional practices can lower infection risk.Because person-to-person transmission through respiratory droplets within a radius of 6 feet is currently thought to be the main way the virus spreads, everyone including healthcare providers can reduce the risk to themselves and others by wearing a mask, practicing physical distancing, washing their hands often, and taking other prevention measures.

CDC analyzes data to determine the level of risk for people with underlying medical conditions and will provide updates over time as new information is available.You know your patients' overall health and how well their conditions are managed. Use your clinical judgment to evaluate each patient's level of risk.Help patients manage their underlying conditions to the best of their ability, encouraging them to take medicines as prescribed and ensuring that patients have sufficient medication and supplies. For example, you may prescribe 3-month supplies of medications to ensure they have access to sufficient medications.Explain to all patients which symptoms of their chronic conditions require emergency care or in-person visits. Stress the importance of obtaining emergency care if needed.Reassure your patients who require emergency care that emergency departments (ED) have infection prevention plans to protect them from acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection in the ED.Tell patients with underlying medical conditionsthat increase their risk of severe illness or poorer outcomes from COVID-19 to:Take precautions to reduce the risk of getting COVID-19.Closely follow your care plans for managing their chronic disease, including, for example, achieving better glycemic or blood pressure control.Seek emergency care if any of their underlying medical conditions worsen and require immediate attention.Encourage all patients, regardless of risk, to:Take steps to protect themselves.Call their healthcare provider if you are sick with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath.Follow CDC travel guidelines and the recommendations of your state and local health officials.Fear and anxiety about a new disease can feel overwhelming, especially for those with underlying risk factors, those in close contact with infected patients, and those with sources of stress outside the workplace.

Are pregnant healthcare providers at increased risk for adverse outcomes if they care for patients with COVID-19?,"Pregnant healthcare providers should follow risk assessment and infection control guidelines for healthcare providers exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting all healthcare providers in healthcare settings. Based on what we know at this time, pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to non-pregnant people. Additionally, there might be an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, among pregnant people with COVID-19.

Are the alternatives to the 14-day quarantine described in the Options to Reduce Quarantine for Contacts of Persons with SARS-CoV-2 Infection Using Symptom Monitoring and Diagnostic Testing recommended for healthcare facilities?,"Given the need for often extensive and close contact between patients and healthcare personnel, a 14-day quarantine period continues to be recommended for patients receiving healthcare and healthcare personnel with exposures to SARS-CoV-2 warranting quarantine1 or work restrictions, respectively. This option maximally reduces post-quarantine transmission risk and is the strategy with the greatest collective experience at present.Alternatives to the 14-day quarantine period are described in the Options to Reduce Quarantine for Contacts of Persons with SARS-CoV-2 Infection Using Symptom Monitoring and Diagnostic Testing. Healthcare facilities could consider these alternatives as a measure to mitigate staffing shortages, space limitations, or PPE supply shortages but, due to the special nature of healthcare settings (e.g., patients at risk for worse outcomes, critical nature of healthcare personnel, challenges with social distancing), not as a preferred option.Healthcare facilities should understand that shortening the duration of work restriction or patient quarantine might pose additional transmission risk. They should also counsel patients and healthcare personnel about the need to monitor for and immediately self-isolate if symptoms occur during the 14 days after their exposure and the importance of adhering to all recommended non-pharmaceutical interventions.1In healthcare settings, patients under quarantine are typically isolated in a single-person room and cared for by healthcare personnel using all PPE recommended for a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, these patients should not be cohorted with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection unless they are also confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection through testing.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Are there circumstances in healthcare settings when repeat testing for SARS-CoV-2 or quarantining might be considered for asymptomatic patients and residents who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection but are re-exposed to SARS-CoV-2 within 3 months of their prior infection?,"CDC currently recommends that asymptomatic patients and residents who have recovered and are within 3 months of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection may not need to be quarantined or tested following re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2. However, there might be clinical scenarios in which the certainty about a prior infection or the durability of the immune response exist, for which providers could consider testing for SARS-CoV-2 and recommending quarantine following an exposure that occurs less than 3 months after their initial infection. Examples could include:Patients or residents with underlying immunocompromising conditions (e.g., patient after organ transplantation) or who become immune compromised (e.g., receive chemotherapy) in the 3 months following SARS-CoV-2 infection and who might have an increased risk for reinfection. However, data on which specific conditions may lead to higher risk and the magnitude of risk are not available.Patients or residents for whom there is concern that their initial diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection might have been based on a false positive test result (e.g., resident was asymptomatic, antigen test positive, and a confirmatory nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) was not performed).Patients or residents for whom there is evidence that they were exposed to a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant (e.g., exposed to a person known to be infected with a novel variant) for which the risk of reinfection might be higherCDC continues to actively investigate the frequency of reinfection and the circumstances surrounding these episodes, including the role that new variants might play in reinfection, and will adjust guidance as necessary as more information becomes available.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Do CDC's interim infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19 apply to psychiatric hospitals or other behavioral health facilities?,"Yes. To keep patients and healthcare personnel (healthcare providers) healthy and safe, CDC's infection prevention and control guidance applies to all settings where healthcare is delivered. However, as with any guidance, facilities can tailor certain recommendations to their setting. For example, inpatient psychiatric care includes communal experiences and group activities that may need to continue. If so, these activities might need to be adapted to align with social distancing recommendations. Other recommended infection control measures (for example, ensuring access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer, cohorting patients with COVID-19 and assigning dedicated staff, or implementing universal source control measures) might not be safe or appropriate to implement in all locations or for all patients due to security and behavioral concerns.Challenges and potential solutions specific to behavioral health settings might include:CohortingChallenge: To prevent transmission, it is generally recommended that patients with COVID-19 be transferred to a separate area of the facility where they can be cared for by dedicated healthcare providers. Because of security concerns or specialized care needs, it might not be possible to cohort certain patients together or change healthcare providers assigned to their care.Potential Solutions: When cohorting is not possible, implement measures to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet) between patients with COVID-19 and others on the unit. Ideally, this would include a separate bathroom for COVID-19 patients. Ensure healthcare providers wear all recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.Group Therapy SessionsChallenge: Group counseling, therapy, and discussion sessions are a critical component of psychiatrictreatment and care plans, but the traditional set-up for these activities is not compatible with social distancing recommendations.Potential Solutions: When possible, use virtual methods, or decrease group size so social distancing can be maintained. In the event that COVID-19 is transmitted in the facility, sessions should stop or move to a video discussion forum until additional infection prevention measures are in place to stop the spread.Cloth Face CoveringsChallenge: For some patients, the use of cloth face coverings or facemasks might pose an additional danger or may cause distress. Some patients may be unable or unwilling to use them as intended. Elastic and cloth straps can be used for strangling oneself or others, and metal nasal bridges can be used for self-harm or as a weapon.Potential Solutions: Consider allowing patients at low risk for misuse to wear cloth face coverings or facemasks, with a preference for those with short ear-loops rather than longer ties. Consider use of cloth face coverings or facemasks during supervised group activities. Ensure that healthcare providers interacting with patients who cannot wear a cloth face covering or facemask are wearing eye protection and a facemask (or a respirator if the patient is suspected to have COVID-19 and respirators are available).Alcohol-based Hand SanitizerChallenge: While alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) containing 60-95% alcohol is an important tool to increase adherence to hand hygiene recommendations, ABHS must be used carefully in psychiatric facilities to ensure it is not ingested by patients.Potential Solutions: Consider not placing ABHS in patients' rooms in psychiatric facilities, nor in locations where the patients have unsupervised access. Encourage frequent hand washing with soap and water for patients and healthcare providers. Consider providing personal, pocket-sized ABHS dispensers for healthcare providers.DiningChallenge: As part of social distancing, communal dining is generally not recommended. However, eating needs to remain supervised due to the potential for self-harm with eating utensils and because commonly used psychiatric medications may cause side effects (e.g., tardive dyskinesia, dysphagia, hypo- and hypersalivation) that increase choking risk for patients.Potential Solutions: One option is to position staff in patients' rooms to monitor their dining. Another option is to allow communal dining in shifts so that staff can monitor patients while ensuring they remain at least 6 feet apart. A third option is to have patients sit in appropriately spaced chairs in the hallway outside their rooms so they can be monitored while they eat.SmokingChallenge: A higher proportion of psychiatric patients smoke cigarettes compared to the general population. Patients might congregate in outdoor smoking spaces without practicing appropriate social distancing.Potential Solutions: Limit the number of patients allowed to access smoking spaces at the same time, and position staff to observe and ensure patients are practicing appropriate physical distancing.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"If a long-term care facility has a resident or staff member with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, how and to whom should this be communicated?","Facilities should follow the reporting requirements of their state or jurisdiction. Those regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (e.g., nursing homes) should also follow all CMS requirements, which are being updated to include new requirements for reporting to CDC and to residents and their representatives.In addition, CDC recommends that health departmentsbe promptly notified about:Residents or healthcare personnel (healthcare providers) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19,Residents with severe respiratory infection resulting in hospitalization or death, and residents or healthcare providers with new-onset respiratory symptoms within 72 hours of each other.These could signal an outbreak of COVID-19 or other respiratory disease in the facility. The health department can provide important guidance to assist with case finding and halting transmission.The facility should also have a plan and mechanism to regularly communicate with residents, family members, and healthcare providers, including if cases of COVID-19 are identified in the facility. Often, information in nursing homes is communicated through town hall meetings and staff meetings, along with letters or emails. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person gatherings should not occur. Instead, communication should occur through virtual meetings over phone or web platforms. These should be supplemented with written communications that provide contact information for a staff member who can respond to questions or concerns. Communications should include information describing the current situation, plans for limiting spread within the facility, and recommended actions they can take to protect themselves and others. Facilities should make this information available in a timely manner and offer periodic updates as the situation develops and more information becomes available.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"Is a negative test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, required before a hospitalized patient can be discharged to a nursing home?","No. For patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection, decisions about discharge from the hospital should be based on their clinical status and the ability of an accepting facility to meet their care needs and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices. Decisions about hospital discharge are distinct from decisions about discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions.For patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, decisions about discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions should be based on the strategies outlined here. The test-based strategy is recommended only for use in limited circumstances.If a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection has not met criteria for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions, they should be transferred to a facility with the ability to adhere to infection prevention and control recommendationsfor the care of residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including placement in a unit or area of the facility designated to care for residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection and provision of recommended personal protective equipment to healthcare personnel.If the patient has met the criteria for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions, they do not require additional restrictions.A patient hospitalized for non-COVID-related illnesses who is not known to have SARS-CoV-2 infection can be transferred to a nursing home without testing. To ensure a patient was not exposed and might subsequently develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, nursing homes should place the patient in Transmission-based Precautionsin a separate observation area or in a single-person room for 14 days after admission.As part of universal source control measures, all residents (including those described in the scenarios above) should wear a cloth face covering or facemask (if tolerated) whenever they leave their room.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, are there special considerations for surgical and other procedural care settings, including performance of aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)?","As part of routine practices, healthcare personnel (healthcare providers) should be applying Standard Precautions. healthcare providers should always deliberately assess potential risks of exposure to infectious material before engaging in activities and procedures in healthcare delivery. Based on their risk assessment, safe work practices, including engineering controls that reduce the release of infectious material, administrative controls,and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be implemented at the point of care according to CDC guidelines and standards of practice for the activity performed.To reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC recommends that facilities:consider nonoperative approaches when feasible;minimize the use of procedures or techniques that might produce infectious aerosols when feasible;minimize the number of people in the operating or procedure room to reduce exposures;use the extent of community transmission and an assessment of the likelihood for patient harm if care is delayed to make decisions about cancelling or postponing elective surgeries and procedures; andimplement universal source control measures, which includes having patients wear a cloth face covering (as tolerated) and having healthcare providers wear a facemask at all times while they are in the healthcare facility.If surgery or procedures cannot be postponed, healthcare providers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should adhere to all recommended infection prevention and control practices for COVID-19. This includes:Using all recommended PPE: an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown.Respirators with exhalation valves should not be used during surgical procedures as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field.If shortages exist, N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirators should be prioritized for procedures involving higher risk techniques (e.g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols) or that involve anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher (e.g., nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract).As part of routine practice, healthcare providers should also be using additional engineering controls for source control, when applicable (e.g., smoke evacuation devices).Because SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by individuals who are infected but do not have symptoms, some infected individuals will not be identified by screening for clinical signs and symptoms. healthcare providers providing surgical or procedural care to patients not suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection should use a tiered approach based on the level of community transmission to inform the need for universal eye protection and respirator use. healthcare providers should continue to use eye protection or an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator whenever recommended for patient care as a part of Standard or Transmission-Based Precautions.In addition to the use of universal PPE and source control in healthcare settings, targeted SARS-CoV-2 testing of patients without signs or symptoms of COVID-19 might be used to identify those with asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and further reduce risk for exposures in some healthcare settings. Depending on guidance from local and state health departments, testing availability, and how rapidly results are available, facilities can consider implementing pre-admission or pre-procedure diagnostic testing with authorized nucleic acid or antigen detection assays for SARS-CoV-2.Testing results might inform decisions about rescheduling elective procedures or about the need for additional Transmission-Based Precautions when caring for the patient. Limitations of using this testing strategy include obtaining negative results in patients during their incubation period who later become infectious and false negative test results, depending on the test method used.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Why does CDC continue to recommend respiratory protection equivalent or higher to the level provided by an N95 disposable filtering facepiece respirator for care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19?,"CDC's guidance to use NIOSH-approved N95 disposable filtering facepiece or higher level respirators when providing care for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 is based on the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and related respiratory viruses.Current data suggest that close-range aerosol transmission by droplet and inhalation, and contact followed by self-delivery to the eyes, nose, or mouth are likely routes of transmission. Long-range aerosol transmission, such as is seen with measles, has not been a feature of SARS-CoV-2.Potential routes of close-range transmission include splashes and sprays of infectious material onto mucous membranes and inhalation of infectious virions exhaled by an infected person. The relative contribution of each of these is not known for SARS-Co-V-2.Facemasks commonly used during surgical procedures will provide barrier protection against droplet sprays contacting mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, but they are not designed to protect wearers from inhaling small particles. N95 and higher level respirators, such as other disposable filtering facepiece respirators, powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), and elastomeric respirators, provide both barrier and respiratory protection because of their tight fit and filtration characteristics.Respirators should be used as part of a respiratory protection program that provides staff with medical evaluations, training, and fit testing.Although facemasks are routinely used for the care of patients with common viral respiratory infections, N95 or higher level respirators are routinely recommended for emerging pathogens like SARS CoV-2, which have the potential for transmission via small particles, the ability to cause severe infections, and no specific treatments or vaccines.CDC recommendations acknowledge the current challenges with limited supplies of N95s and other respirators. Facilities that do not have sufficient supplies of N95s and other respirators for all patient care should prioritize their use for activities and procedures that pose high risks of generating infectious aerosols and use facemasks for care that does not involve those activities or procedures. Detailedstrategies for optimizing the supply of N95 respiratorsare available on the CDC website. Once availability of supplies is reestablished, the guidance states that the use of N95 and higher level respirators should resume.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn by individuals transporting patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within a healthcare facility? For example, what PPE should be worn when transporting the patient to radiology for imaging that cannot be performed in the patient room?","In general, transport and movement of a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of their room should be limited to medically essential purposes. If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (healthcare providers) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask or cloth face covering (if tolerated) to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet.If transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e.g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wearall recommended PPE(gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemaskif a respirator is not availableand eye protection [i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). This recommendation is needed because these interactions typically involve close, often face-to-face, contact with the patient in an enclosed space (e.g., patient room). Once the patient has been transferred to the wheelchair or gurney (and prior to exiting the room), transporters should remove their gown and gloves and perform hand hygiene.The transporter should continue to wear a respirator or facemask. The continued use of eye protection by the transporter is also recommended if there is potential that the patient might not be able to tolerate their facemask or cloth face covering for the duration of transport. Additional PPE should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e.g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask).After arrival at their destination, receiving personnel (e.g., in radiology) and the transporter (if assisting with transfer) should perform hand hygiene and wearall recommended PPE. If still wearing their original respirator or facemask and eye protection, the transporter should take care to avoid self-contamination when donning the remainder of the recommended PPE. This cautious approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States.Interim guidance for EMS personnel transporting patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection isavailable here. EMS personnel should wear all recommended PPE because they are providing direct medical care and in close contact with the patient for longer periods of time.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn by environmental services (EVS) personnel who clean and disinfect rooms of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection?,"In general, only essential personnel should enter the room of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Healthcare facilities should consider assigning daily cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces to nursing personnel who will already be in the room providing care to the patient. If this responsibility is assigned to EVS personnel, they should wear allrecommended PPEwhen in the room. PPE should be removed upon leaving the room, immediately followed by performance of hand hygiene.After discharge, terminal cleaning can be performed by EVS personnel. They should delay entry into the room until time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. After this time has elapsed, EVS personnel can enter the room and should wear a facemask(for source control) along with a gown and gloves when performing terminal cleaning. Eye protection should be added if splashes or sprays during cleaning and disinfection activities are anticipated or otherwise required based on the selected cleaning products. Shoe covers are not recommended at this time for personnel caring for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Which procedures are considered aerosol generating procedures in healthcare settings?,"Some procedures performed on patients are more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols than coughing, sneezing, talking, or breathing. These aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) potentially put healthcare personnel and others at an increased risk for pathogen exposure and infection.Development of a comprehensive list of AGPs for healthcare settings has not been possible, due to limitations in available data on which procedures may generate potentially infectious aerosols and the challenges in determining if reported transmissions during AGPs are due to aerosols or other exposures.There is neither expert consensus, nor sufficient supporting data, to create a definitive and comprehensive list of AGPs for healthcare settings.Commonly performed medical procedures that are often considered AGPs, or that create uncontrolled respiratory secretions, include:open suctioning of airwayssputum inductioncardiopulmonary resuscitationendotracheal intubation and extubationnon-invasive ventilation (e.g., BiPAP, CPAP)bronchoscopymanual ventilationBased on limited available data, it is uncertain whether aerosols generated from some procedures may be infectious, such as:nebulizer administration*high flow O2 delivery*Aerosols generated by nebulizers are derived from medication in the nebulizer. It is uncertain whether potential associations between performing this common procedure and increased risk of infection might be due to aerosols generated by the procedure or due to increased contact between those administering the nebulized medication and infected patients.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
How long does an examination room need to remain vacant after being occupied by a patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19?,"Although spread of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be primarily via respiratory droplets, the contribution of small respirable particles to close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. Airborne transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely.The amount of time that the air inside an examination room remains potentially infectious is not known and may depend on a number of factors including the size of the room, the number of air changes per hour, how long the patient was in the room, if the patient was coughing or sneezing, and if an aerosol-generating procedure was performed. Facilities will need to consider these factors when deciding when the vacated room can be entered by someone who is not wearing PPE.For a patient who was not coughing or sneezing, did not undergo an aerosol-generating procedure, and occupied the room for a short period of time (e.g., a few minutes), any risk to healthcare providers and subsequent patients likely dissipates over a matter of minutes. However, for a patient who was coughing and remained in the room for a longer period of time or underwent an aerosol-generating procedure, the risk period is likely longer.For these higher risk scenarios, it is reasonable to apply a similar time period as that used for pathogens spread by the airborne route (e.g., measles, tuberculosis) and to restrict healthcare providers and patients without PPE from entering the room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles.General guidance onclearance rates under differing ventilation conditionsis available.In addition to ensuring sufficient time for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles, healthcare providers should clean and disinfect environmental surfaces and shared equipment before the room is used for another patient.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"My hospital is experiencing a shortage of isolation gowns. To preserve our supply, can we stop using gowns for the care of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other endemic multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), and Clostridioides difficile?","CDC has released information aboutstrategies to optimize the supply of isolation gowns. Healthcare facilities should refer to that guidance and implement the recommended strategies to optimize their current supply of gowns. This includes shifting toward the use of washable cloth gowns, if feasible.The use of gowns as part of Contact Precautions in the context of MDROs has been implemented primarily to reduce the risk of transmission to other patients rather than to protect healthcare personnel (healthcare providers). Facilities with shortages could consider suspending the use of gowns for the care of patients with endemic MDROs, such as MRSA, VRE, and ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacilli except as required forStandard Precautions. Facilities should assess their local epidemiology to determine which MDROs are considered endemic. Regardless of the use of gowns, healthcare providers at facilities should continue to wear gloves for contact with these patients and their environment. Hand hygiene should continue to be emphasized. Facilities should also attempt to place patients colonized or infected with an MDRO in a private room, if available.Caring for patients who have highly resistant Gram-negative organisms (e.g., carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriacae) and other MDROs (e.g.,Candida auris) that are not considered endemic:Rather than gowns being donned for every room entry, they should be reserved for use as part of Standard Precautionsand also prioritized for high-contact patient care activities that pose highest risk for transfer of pathogens from the patient to healthcare providers. Examples of such high-contact care activities include dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, providing hygiene, changing linens, changing briefs or assisting with toileting, device care or use (central line, urinary catheter, feeding tube, tracheostomy/ventilator), and wound care. To further preserve gowns, healthcare providers are recommended to bundle high-contact care activities as part of individual care encounters. Regardless of the use of gowns, healthcare providers at facilities should continue to wear gloves for contact with these patients and their environment. Hand hygiene should continue to be emphasized. Facilities should also attempt to place patients colonized or infected with an MDRO in a private room, if available.Caring for patients withClostridioides difficileinfections (CDI):Facilities should continue using Contact Precautions (putting on a gown and gloves upon entry into the patient's room and placing the patient in a private room) for the care of symptomatic patients with CDI. As part of asupplemental strategy to prevent transmission of CDI, some facilities have implemented Contact Precautions for the care of patients at high risk for CDI who have asymptomatic carriage ofClostridioides difficile. There are limited data about the role of asymptomatic carriage in transmission of CDI. In this setting of a critical national shortage of gowns, facilities should consider suspending this approach until the shortage is addressed. Gowns should still be used as part of Standard Precautions.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"A healthcare provider at our facility was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. What time period and criteria do we use to determine the patients, visitors, and other healthcare personnel (healthcare providers) who might have been exposed to this individual while he/she was potentially infectious?","Anyone who had prolonged close contact (within 6 feet for a cumulative total of 15 minutesor more over a 24-hour period) with the infected healthcare provider might have been exposed.If the provider had COVID-19 symptoms, the provider is considered potentially infectious beginning 2 days before symptoms first appeared until the provider meets criteria to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or Home Isolation.If the provider did not have symptoms, collecting information about when the provider may have been exposed could help inform the period when they were infectious.If an exposure is identified. The provider should be considered potentially infectious beginning 2 days after the exposure until criteria to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or Home Isolation are met.If the date of exposure cannot be determined. For the purposes of contact tracing, it is reasonable to use a cutoff of 2 days before the specimen testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was collected as the starting point, continuing until the criteria to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or Home Isolation are met. Although the infectious period is generally accepted to be 10 days after onset of infection, eliciting contacts during the entire 10 days before obtaining the specimen that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 is likely inefficient. In most situations an exposed provider cannot recall all contacts over the preceding 10 days. Also, because recent data suggest that asymptomatic persons may have a lower viral burden at diagnosis than symptomatic persons, the additional resources required may divert case investigation and contact tracing resources away from activities most likely to interrupt ongoing transmission.Contact tracing is generally recommended for anyone who had prolonged close contact with the person with SARS-CoV-2 infection during these time periods. While this question addresses exposure to a potentially infectious provider, the following actions are also recommended if the potentially infectious individual is a patient or visitor.Recommended actions for healthcare providers, patients, and visitors:Perform a risk assessment and apply work restrictions for other healthcare providers who were exposed to the infected provider based on whether these healthcare providers had prolonged, close contact and what PPE they were wearing. More detailed information is available in the Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Work Restrictions for Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure to COVID-19.Place exposed patients who are currently admitted to the healthcare facility in appropriate Transmission-Based Precautions and monitor them for onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection until 14 days after their last exposure.Contacts who are within 3 months of onset of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection might not require quarantine or testing if they remain asymptomatic.Perform contact tracing of exposed patients who are not currently admitted to the healthcare facility and for visitors as described in Health Departments: Interim Guidance on Developing a COVID-19 Case Investigation and Contact Tracing Plan.Healthcare facilities should have a process for notifying the health department about known or suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and should establish a plan, in consultation with local public health authorities, for how exposures in a healthcare facility will be investigated and how contact tracing will be performed. The plan should address the following:Who is responsible for identifying contacts and notifying potentially exposed individuals?How will such notifications occur?What actions and follow-up are recommended for those who were exposed?Contact tracing should be carried out in a way that protects the confidentiality of affected individuals to the extent possible and is consistent with applicable laws and regulations. healthcare providers and patients who are currently admitted to the facility or were transferred to another healthcare facility should be prioritized for notification. These groups, if infected, have the potential to expose a large number of individuals at higher risk for severe disease, or in the situation of admitted patients, be at higher risk for severe illness themselves.Information for health departments about case investigation and contact tracing is available in the Health Departments: Interim Guidance on Developing a COVID-19 Case Investigation and Contact Tracing Plan. This guidance could also be helpful to healthcare facilities performing such activities.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"A healthcare provider in our facility worked while infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the provider wore a facemask at all times while interacting with patients. Are the patients at risk for SARS-CoV-2 and should they be notified?","Anyone who had prolonged close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes) should be considered potentially exposed. The use of a facemaskfor source control and adherence to other recommended infection prevention and control (IPC) measures (e.g., hand hygiene) by the provider help to reduce the risk of transmission or severe illness. In areas with moderate to substantial community transmission, patients are already at risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to exposures outside their home and should be alert to the development of signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19.The following should be considered when determining which patients are at higher risk for transmission and might be prioritized for evaluation and testing:Facemask use by the patient - Mirroring the risk assessment guidance for healthcare personnel, patients not wearing a facemask would likely be at higher risk for infection compared to those that were wearing a facemask.Type of interaction that occurred between the patient and infected provider - An interaction involving manipulation or prolonged close contact with the patient's eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., dental cleaning) likely poses higher risk of transmission to the patient compared to other interactions (e.g., blood pressure check).PPE used by infected healthcare providers - healthcare providers wearing a facemask(or respirator) and face shield that extends down below the chin might have had better source control than wearing only a facemask. Note that respirators with exhalation valves might not provide source control.Current status of patient - Is the patient currently admitted to a hospital or long-term care facility? These individuals, if infected, can be at higher risk for severe illness and have the potential to expose large numbers of individuals at risk for severe disease.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"If healthcare personnel (healthcare providers) are living with someone who has been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, should they be excluded from work? If so, for how long?","Yes. healthcare providers who have any kind of exposure for which home quarantine is recommended should be excluded from work:If healthcare providers are able to quarantine away from the infected individual living with them, they should quarantine at home and not come into work for 14 days following their last exposure to the infected individual.If healthcare providers are not able to quarantine away from the infected individual living with them and have ongoing unprotected exposure throughout the duration of the individual's illness, they should remain in home quarantine and be excluded from work until 14 days after the infected individual meets criteria for discontinuation of home isolation.If healthcare providers develop SARS-CoV-2 infection while they are in quarantine, they should be excluded from work until they meet all return to work criteria for healthcare providers with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Home quarantine and work exclusion of asymptomatic exposed healthcare providers who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prior 3 months might not be necessary.

"If a confirmatory test is performed on a person with a potential false-positive antigen test result or a potential false-negative result, what infection prevention and control (IPC) measures should be enacted while the result is pending?","When confirmatory testing is performed on a person with a potential false-positive antigen test result, IPC measures should be maintained pending the result. Additional testing of close contacts can be delayed until results of confirmatory testing are available unless symptomatic individuals are identified.For asymptomatic healthcare personnel (healthcare providers), this includes continuing exclusion from work pending confirmatory testing.For asymptomatic patients or residents, this includes placement on Transmission-Based Precautionsin a single room or, if single rooms are not available, remaining in their current room pending results of confirmatory testing. They should not be transferred to a COVID-19 unit or placed in another shared room with new roommates.Given the generally lower sensitivity of antigen tests, people with COVID-19-like symptoms who have a negative antigen test result should have a confirmatory nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in most situations. Pending the results of confirmatory testing, maintain the following IPC measures:Patients and residents with COVID-19-like symptoms should be placed on Transmission-Based Precautions in a single room (not on the COVID-19 unit)healthcare providers with COVID-19-like symptoms should be excluded from work until the confirmatory test results are available.Despite the potential need for confirmatory testing of negative results, the initial use of antigen tests for symptomatic people is still preferred if turnaround time for a NAAT is >2 days because a positive antigen test would initiate contact tracing and implementation of IPC measures.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"Using two masks at the same time, including the use of a cloth mask over a medical facemask, to improve the fit of facemasks in healthcare settings","CDC has recommended several ways to improve the fit and filtrationof masks, including covering a medical facemask with a cloth mask. However, layering masks requires special care in healthcare settings.Although a cloth mask can be used over a medical facemask to improve fit, there may be better alternatives such as framed fitters or using a knot-and-tuckapproach to achieve a good fit. If a good fit is achieved using a single medical facemask, additional approaches like adding layers to achieve a better fit might not be necessary.Cloth masks are not personal protective equipment (PPE). They should not be used in place of medical facemasks or NIOSH-approvedrespirators as part of Standard or Transmission-based Precautions.Wearing a medical facemask or cloth mask over an N95 respirator is not recommended for healthcare personnel in healthcare settings except as a contingency or crisis strategyduring extended use of N95 respirators to protect the respirator from contamination during aerosol-generating procedures or procedures that might generate splashes and sprays.Wearing a medical facemask or cloth mask under an N95 respirator is never recommended as it will interfere with the seal.In healthcare settings, medical facemasks are used by healthcare personnel for two general purposes.First, as PPE to protect a healthcare worker's nose and mouth from exposure to splashes, sprays, splatter, and respiratory secretions, such as when treating patients on Droplet Precautions. When used as PPE, medical facemasks should be removed and discarded after each patient encounter unless extended use is being practiced as part of a crisis or contingency capacity strategy.If a cloth mask is used over the medical facemask, it should be removed and launderedafter each patient encounter.Cloth masks are not PPE and should not be used alone to protect against splashes and sprays, such as when used while treating patients on Droplet Precautions.Second, for source control to cover a healthcare worker's nose and mouth to prevent spread of respiratory secretions from the healthcare worker to other people. When used for source control, medical facemasks, including cloth masks that are used to cover medical facemasks to improve the fit, may be used for the duration of a shift unless they become soiled, damaged, or hard to breathe through; medical facemasks, including cloth masks, used for source control should be removed and discarded (or laundered if a cloth mask) at least after each workday.Once put on, healthcare personnel should not touch their medical facemask or cloth mask. If they touch or adjust their medical facemask or cloth mask, they must perform hand hygiene before and after contact.If laundering at the intervals described above cannot be performed, then cloth masks should not be used by healthcare personnel in healthcare settings.*Medical facemasks are personal protective equipment (PPE) and are often referred to as surgical masks or procedure masks. Use facemasks according to product labeling and local, state, and federal requirements. FDA-cleared surgical masks are designed to protect against splashes and sprays and are prioritized for use when such exposures are anticipated, including surgical procedures. Facemasks that are not regulated by FDA, such as some procedure masks, which are typically used for isolation purposes, may not provide protection against splashes and sprays.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
When is someone infectious?,"The onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known with certainty. Based on current evidence, scientists believe that persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 may shed replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 for up to 10 days following symptom onset, while a small fraction of persons with severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised persons, may shed replication-competent virus for up to 20 days. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to infections with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. Based on existing literature, the incubation period (the time from exposure to development of symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g., MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) ranges from 2-14 days.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Which body fluids can spread infection?,"SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in cell culture from the stool of some patients, including a patient with pneumonia 15 days after symptom onset. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known but may be several weeks or longer. Duration of several weeks or longer has been observed in cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. While viable, infectious SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens, viable, infectious MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. It is not yet known whether other non-respiratory body fluids from an infected person including blood, vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious SARS-CoV-2.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Can people who recover from COVID-19 be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2?,"CDC is aware of recent reports indicating that persons who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 can be re-infected. These reports can understandably cause concern. The immune response, including duration of immunity, to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet understood. Based on what we know from other viruses, including common human coronaviruses, some reinfections are expected. Ongoing COVID-19 studies will help establish the frequency and severity of reinfection and who might be at higher risk for reinfection. At this time, whether you have had COVID-19 or not, the best ways to prevent infection are to wear a mask in public places, stay at least 6 feet away from other people, frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and avoid crowds and confined spaces.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
How do you test a patient for infection with SARS-CoV-2?,"Clinicians are able to access laboratory testing through state and local public health laboratories, as well as commercial and clinical laboratories across the country. The Association of Public Health Laboratories provides a list of states and territories with laboratories that are using COVID-19 viral tests. For more information, see Testing in U.S. Clinicians should direct testing questions to their state health departments. Commercial reference laboratories are also able to offer a larger volume of testing for SARS-CoV-2.CDC has guidancefor who should be tested, but decisions about testing are at the discretion of state and local health departments and/or individual clinicians.Healthcare providers should report positive results to their local/state health department CDC does not directly collect these data directly.See recommendations for prioritization of testing, and instructions for specimen collection at Testing Overview for COVID-19.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Do existing commercially available multiple respiratory virus panels detect SARS-CoV-2?,"Yes. There are commercially developed respiratory panels with multi-pathogen molecular assays that can detect respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and other human coronaviruses that can cause acute respiratory illness.

Should chest CT be used for diagnosis of COVID-19?,"Clinicians considering use of chest CT scans for diagnosis or management of COVID-19 patients should consider whether such imaging will change clinical management. The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends that CT should not be used to screen for COVID-19, or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19, and that CT should be used sparingly and reserved for hospitalized, symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications for CT. Appropriate infection control procedures should be followed before scanning subsequent patients. ",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Whom should healthcare providers notify if they suspect a patient has COVID-19?,"Healthcare providers should immediately notify infection control personnel at their facility if they suspect COVID-19 in a patient.

How do you diagnose and report a potential case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)?,"Patients with MIS-C have presented with a persistent fever and a variety of signs and symptoms including multiorgan (e.g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, hematologic, dermatologic, neurologic) involvement and elevated inflammatory markers. Not all children will have the same symptoms. For children who may have MIS-C, further evaluation for signs of this syndrome may include (but are not limited to) chest radiograph, echocardiography, and blood testing to evaluate for evidence of inflammation.Healthcare providers who have cared or are caring for patients younger than 21 years of age meeting MIS-C criteria should report suspected cases to their local, state, or territorial health department. After hour phone numbers for health departments are available at the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists website.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
How can public health jurisdictions prioritize testing across nursing homes when resources are limited?,"Generally, nursing homes are recommended to test:Residents and healthcare personnel (healthcare providers) with signs or symptoms of COVID-19Residents and healthcare providers who are asymptomatic in response to an outbreak in the facility (i.e., a new SARS-CoV-2 infection in any healthcare providers or any SARS-CoV-2 infection in a resident)All residents and healthcare providers once and serially test healthcare providers who are asymptomatic in facilities without an outbreak as required by CMS.Health departments should have a plan on how to prioritize facilitieswhen testing capacity is limited.If testing capacity is limited for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, prioritize testing (1) of residents and healthcare personnel (healthcare providers) with signs or symptoms of COVID-19 and (2) asymptomatic residents and healthcare providers in response to an outbreak in the facility. When testing capacity is limited or test turnaround times are >2 days, testing healthcare providers who are asymptomatic in facilities without an outbreak should be considered lower priority.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Is there an optimal frequency for testing residents and healthcare providers who previously tested negative in nursing homes as part of an outbreak response?,"As part of an outbreak response, CDC recommends that residents and healthcare providers(who have not had a prior infection in the last 90 days) have viral testing (e.g., RT-PCR or antigen) immediately after the first new COVID-19 case is identified at the facility. Then the facility should perform serial testing of all residents and healthcare providers who previously tested negative every 3-7 days until no new positive tests have been identified for 14 days. In nursing homes with outbreaks, most cases are identified within the first two weeks of diagnosing the first new case. These early cases likely occur among people who were previously exposed or were infected before more infection prevention and control (IPC) measures were implemented in response to the outbreak.For this reason, if testing capacity allows and does not divert staff and resources away from performing other critical IPC measures (e.g., ensuring effective implementation of Transmission-Based Precautionsfor infected and potentially exposed residents), the facility should consider testing more frequently (e.g., every 3 days) for the first two weeks of the outbreak, then test less frequently (e.g., every 7 days) thereafter until no new cases are identified for 14 days. As an example, testing would occur on day 0 (day the first case is identified), days 3, 6, 9, and 12, and then on days 19, 26, etc.This increased frequency of testing might not be possible in many facilities (e.g., lack of testing supplies or diversion of resources from other patient care activities). A minimum frequency of testing every 7 days is recommended until no new positive tests have been identified for 14 days. The effectiveness of increased frequency of testing is substantially diminished if IPC measures are not maintained. Facilities should ensure adherence to appropriate IPC measures in outbreak settings, including use of Transmission-Based Precautionsfor the care of all residents (even those who have negative tests) on affected units (or facility-wide, if cases are widespread). Facilities should also ensure rapid turnaround time of less than 2 days from specimen collection to test result.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Should residents in nursing homes who are asymptomatic be tested in non-outbreak settings?,"Unrecognized SARS-CoV-2 is most often introduced into a nursing home by asymptomatic healthcare personnel (healthcare providers) or visitors with COVID-19 who work at or visit the nursing home, rather than residents. Recommendations for testing of residents who are asymptomatic in nursing homes is generally reserved for situations such as response to an outbreak in the facility (i.e., a new SARS-CoV-2 infection in any healthcare providers or any SARS-CoV-2 infection in a resident) or evaluation of a resident who has had close contactwith someone with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.Regular testing of asymptomatic residents can result in false-positive results and potentially result in additional unnecessary testing. If testing capacity allows, consideration could be given to regular serial testing of residents who are asymptomatic and who frequently leave the facility for medical treatment and then return (e.g. residents who receive regular hemodialysis, including those who are dialyzed at an onsite facility that treats nursing home and community patients), especially in communities where there is moderate to substantial community transmission. Such residents might be at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infections because of their frequent exposures outside the nursing home. These exposures can be from community patients, staff members during ambulatory care or during transportation; however, the benefit of serial testing of residents is not known.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
When should an antigen test result be considered a false positive?,"Research studies report that the specificity of antigen tests and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), are generally similar and high. However, false-positive resultsmay occur with any test, even those that have very high sensitivity and specificity.A point-of-care antigen test result should be considered a possible false-positive when a positive test result appears inconsistent with the clinical situation (e.g., a positive antigen test in an asymptomatic person who does not have risk factors and resides in a community with lower COVID-19 prevalence). When a false-positive test is suspected, nursing homes and health departments should also review and gather the following information:Review the FDA EUA and instructions for use of the point-of-care antigen test to ensure correct use. For instance, the use of viral transport medium has been shown to produce false-positive results in some tests and should not be used for some antigen platforms (including BD Veritor and Quidel Sofia platforms). For further information on appropriate use of point of care tests, see Specimen Collection and Handling of Point of Care Tests.Review recent control results to ensure accuracy of the antigen test platform. If able, perform procedural quality control tests to ensure correct operation of the platform.Compare the percent positivity of the samples that were run that day (or week) to their previous percent positivity (e.g., their rolling 7-day average percent positive). Identifying many positives in one day might indicate an issue with the antigen results (either due to operator error or faulty test supplies).Consider the pre-test probability of disease. If testing a population with a COVID-19 prevalence of <1% (e.g., screening asymptomatic healthcare providers in non-outbreak settings) with a single test with 99% specificity, the positive predictive value (probability that a positive test is a true-positive) could be <40%. In other words, in such situations, fewer than 4 of every 10 positive tests represent a true positive. If the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population is >10% (e.g., testing asymptomatic residents and healthcare providers as part of an outbreak response) with that same test with 99% specificity, the positive predictive value may be >90%. In such situations, more than 9 of every 10 positive tests represent a true positive. Therefore, testing in low-prevalence populations with antigen or RT-PCR tests might produce false positives, but that is less likely in outbreak settings.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"If a nursing home is concerned about a false-positive antigen test result, what confirmatory test should be performed?","In most instances, CDC guidancecurrently recommends performing confirmatory testing when asymptomatic individuals are antigen positive.If confirmatory testing is performed, facilities can optimize the performance of the confirmatory test by doing the following:Use nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as the confirmatory test. The utility of performing a confirmatory test with a second antigen test (either with the same platform or a different platform) is not known; repeating the test using antigen platforms might not be helpful if there are concerns about operator error contributing to false-positive results.Optimize sensitivity of the confirmatory test by collecting a high-quality specimen to ensure the confirmatory test does not produce a false negative result.Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs used correctly have a higher sensitivity than other specimen sources. Therefore, confirmatory tests should be performed using NP swabs.The quality of the specimen can impact sensitivity, which can be lower in residents who are not able to follow instructions or those who are intolerant of being tested. If the person is unable to tolerate a NP swab, then a swab of the anterior nares or mid-turbinate could be considered as collection of these specimen types are more tolerable, and have similar or slightlylower sensitivity.Select a confirmatory test with high sensitivity. Thesensitivity of different RT-PCRNAAT platforms variesand the facility can check theFDA EUAof the platform.Perform the confirmatory test within 2 days of the initial test. Tests performed >2 days apart should be considered separate tests, and discordant results may be due to changes in viral dynamics.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Should residents or healthcare providers who have a positive antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 be tested as part of facility-wide testing?,"Yes. To determine if residents and healthcare providers have a current infection, they should have a viral test (e.g., reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) regardless of their antibody test result. A positive antibody test result shows that an individual has antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19, or possibly from infection with a related virus from the same family of viruses (called coronavirus), such as one that causes the common cold. We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 can protect someone from getting infected again or, if they do, how long this protection might last. Therefore, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose COVID-19 and should not be used to inform infection prevention actions.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
How should facilities approach residents who decline testing?,"Residents, or their medical powers of attorney, have the right to decline testing. Clinical discussions about testing may include alternative specimen collection sources that may be more acceptable to residents than nasopharyngeal swabs (e.g., anterior nares). Providing information about the method of testing and reason for pursuing testing may facilitate discussions with residents and their medical powers of attorney.If a resident has symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but declines testing, they should remain on Transmission-Based Precautions until they meet the symptom-based criteria for discontinuation.If a resident is asymptomatic and declines testing at the time of facility-wide testing, decisions on placing the resident on Transmission-Based Precautions for COVID-19 or providing usual care should be based on whether the facility has evidence suggesting SARS-CoV-2 transmission (i.e., confirmed infection in healthcare providers or nursing-home onset infection in a resident).Only residents who have a confirmed positive viral test should be moved to COVID-19-designated units or facilities.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
How should facilities approach healthcare providers who decline testing?,"If healthcare providers with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 decline testing, they should be presumed to have COVID-19 and excluded from work. Return to work decisions should be based on COVID-19 return to work guidance at the discretion of the facility's occupational health program.If asymptomatic healthcare providers decline testing, work restriction, if any, should be determined by the facility's occupational health and local jurisdiction policies. All staff should be trained in proper use of personal protective equipment, including universal facemask policies, hand hygiene, and other measures needed to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"If healthcare providers work at multiple facilities, do they need to receive a viral test at each facility?","No, healthcare providers do not need to be tested at each facility. If documentation of the test result is provided to each facility, the results from one setting are adequate to meet the testing recommendations at any facility. Each facility should maintain appropriate documentation of test results and have a plan to evaluate and manage healthcare providers. healthcare providers should be encouraged to tell facilities if they have had exposures at other facilities with recognized COVID-19 cases.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Should asymptomatic healthcare providers who are tested as part of facility-wide testing be excluded from work while waiting for test results?,"If healthcare providers remain asymptomatic, they may continue working while awaiting test results, unless work restrictions have been implemented by the occupational health program because of an exposure warranting exclusion from work.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Should post-exposure prophylaxis be used for people who may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19?,"There is currently no FDA-approved post-exposure prophylaxis for people who may have been exposed to COVID-19. For information about registered clinical trials of investigational therapeutics for pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.For more information on movement restrictions, monitoring for symptoms, and evaluation after possible exposure to COVID-19, see Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings and Interim U.S Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).The National Institutes of Health recently published guidelines on prophylaxis use for COVID-19 and testing and management of COVID-19 patients. For more information, please visit: National Institutes of Health: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treatment Guidelines.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
How are COVID-19 patients treated?,"Not all patients with COVID-19 will require medical supportive care. Clinical management for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is focused on supportive care for complications, including supplemental oxygen and advanced organ support for respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Empiric testing and treatment for other viral or bacterial etiologies may be warranted.The National Institutes of Health has published interim guidelines for the medical management of COVID-19 prepared by the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Do patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 need to be admitted to the hospital?,"Not all patients with COVID-19 require hospital admission. Patients whose clinical presentation warrants in-patient clinical management for supportive medical care should be admitted to the hospital under appropriate Transmission-Based Precautions.Some patients with initial mild clinical presentation may worsen in the second week of illness. The decision to monitor these patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient's ability to engage in self-monitoring, the feasibility of safe isolation at home, and the risk of transmission in the patient's home environment. For more information, see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Healthcare Setting and Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
When can patients with confirmed COVID-19 be discharged from the hospital?,"Patients can be discharged from the healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated. Meeting criteria for discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautionsis not a prerequisite for discharge from a healthcare facility. Isolation should be maintained at home if the patient returns home before the time period recommended for discontinuation of hospital Transmission-Based Precautions.Decisions to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or in-home isolation should be made according to the following guidance:For hospitalized persons, see Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Healthcare Settings.For non-hospitalized persons, see Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for COVID-19 and Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
What do we know about detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA after clinical recovery from COVID-19?,"Many recovered persons do not have detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract specimens. However, viral RNA can be persistently detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory tract samples in some persons after apparent clinical recovery. In some persons, after testing negative by RT-PCR in two consecutive samples, later samples can test positive again. These persistent detections of viral RNA usually are associated with higher cycle threshold (Ct) values (i.e., fewer RNA copies) than Ct values found in RT-PCR results from samples collected shortly before or during clinical illness. Studies that have examined how long SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in adults have demonstrated that, in some persons, it can be detected for weeks.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Are clinically recovered persons infectious to others if they test persistently or recurrently positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA?,"Whether the presence of detectable but low concentrations of viral RNA after clinical recovery represents the presence of potentially infectious virus is unknown. Based on experience with other viruses, it is unlikely that such persons pose an important infectious risk to others. However, whether this is true for SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been definitively established.After the onset of illness, the detectable viral burden usually declines. After a week or more, anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin becomes detectable and then antibody levels increase. Some of these antibodies may prevent the virus from infecting cells in cell culture. A decline in viral RNA is associated with a decreased ability to isolate live virus. For most patients with COVID-19, efforts to isolate live virus from upper respiratory tract specimens have been unsuccessful when specimens are collected more than 10 days after illness onset. Recovery of live virus between 10 and 20 days after symptom onset has been documented in some persons with severe COVID-19; in some cases, these persons were in an immunocompromised state.Persons who have tested persistently or recurrently positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA have, in some cases, had their signs and symptoms of COVID-19 improve. When viral isolation in tissue culture has been attempted in such persons in South Korea and the United States, live virus has not been isolated. There is no evidence to date that clinically recovered persons with persistent or recurrent detection of viral RNA have transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to others.Despite these observations, it's not possible to conclude that all persons with persistent or recurrent detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA are no longer infectious. There is no firm evidence that the antibodies that develop in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are protective. If these antibodies are protective, it's not known what antibody levels are needed to protect against reinfection.These data and experience with other viral respiratory infections indicate that most persons recovered from COVID-19 who test persistently or recurrently positive by RT-PCR are likely no longer infectious. Isolation and precautions may be discontinued for persons with COVID-19 10 days after symptom onset (the date on which symptoms first began, including non-respiratory symptoms), provided their fever has resolved for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and their other symptoms have improved. For some persons with severe or critical illness, or who are severely immunocompromised, isolation and precautionsmay be maintained for up to 20 days after symptom onset.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Can cycle threshold (Ct) values be used to assess when a person is no longer infectious?,"No. Although attempts to culture virus from upper respiratory specimens have been largely unsuccessful when Ct values are in high but detectable ranges, Ct values are not a quantitative measure of viral burden. In addition, Ct values are not standardized by RT-PCR platform nor have they been approved by FDA for use in clinical management. CDC does not endorse or recommend use of Ct values to assess when a person is no longer infectious. However, serial Ct values may be useful in the context of the entire body of information available when assessing recovery and resolution of infection.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
What further evidence is needed to be reassured that persistent or recurrent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA after recovery does not represent the presence of infectious virus?,"Prospectively collecting serial respiratory samples and attempting to isolate live virus in tissue culture from multiple persons testing positive by RT-PCR following illness recovery is needed. If repeated attempts to recover replication-competent virus in culture from such serial samples are unsuccessful, that data would be sufficient evidence that infectious virus is absent. Then we would be sure that persons continuing to test positive do not pose an infectious risk to others.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Can viral culture be used to demonstrate that a person who had persistently or recurrently detectable viral RNA is not infectious to others?,"Yes. However, viral culture is not widely performed for SARS-CoV-2. It must be conducted in Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories using BSL-3 practices by experienced virologists and culture results can take a week or more. Therefore, while persons whose specimens do not yield live virus are considered no longer infectious, the complexity of such testing and the time required to complete it mean that culture cannot be used routinely to guide management of infected persons.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"A person who previously tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and clinically recovered from COVID-19 is later tested again, for example, as part of a contract tracing investigation. If that person again tests positive by RT-PCR, should they be managed as potentially infectious to others, and isolated again for COVID-19?","For persons who remain asymptomatic following recovery from COVID-19, retesting (e.g., as part of a contact tracing investigation) is not necessary during the first 3 months after the date of symptom onset. When a positive test occurs less than 3 months after the person's symptom onset of their most recent illness, it is possible that the positive test represents a new infection or a persistently positive test associated with the previous infection. If a positive test occurs more than 3 months after a person's symptom onset, clinicians and public health authorities should consider the possibility of reinfection. Until we have more information, the determination of whether a patient with a positive test in these situations is contagious to others should be made on a case-by-case basis. Consider consultation with infectious diseases specialists and public health authorities to review all available information (e.g., medical history, time from initial positive test, RT-PCR Ct values, and presence of COVID-19 signs or symptoms). Persons who are determined to be potentially infectious should undergo evaluation and remain isolated until they again meet criteria for discontinuation of isolation or discontinuation of transmission-based precautions, depending on their circumstances.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"If a previously infected person has clinically recovered but later experiences symptoms consistent with COVID-19, should the person be isolated again and tested for SARS-CoV-2?","If a previously infected person experiences new symptoms consistent with COVID-19 3 months or more after the date of the previous illness onset (or date of last positive viral diagnostic test [RT-PCR or antigen test] if the person never experienced symptoms), the person should undergo repeat viral diagnostic testing. However, serologic testing should not be used to establish the presence or absence of SARS-COV-2 infection or reinfection. These people who have a positive test result should be considered infectious and remain isolated until they again meet criteria for discontinuation of isolation or of transmission-based precautions. Contact tracing during the person's second episode of symptoms is warranted.For persons who have recovered from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and who experience new symptoms consistent with COVID-19 within 3 months since the date of symptom onset of the previous illness episode (or date of last positive viral diagnostic test if the person never experienced symptoms), repeating viral diagnostic testing may be warranted if alternative etiologies for the illness cannot be identified. If reinfection is suspected and retesting is undertaken, the person should follow isolation recommendations for cases of COVID-19 pending clinical evaluation and testing results. Results of repeat testing should also be interpreted in consultation with an infectious disease specialist with consideration of cycle threshold values (if available) and clinical presentations. The determination of whether a patient with a subsequently positive test is contagious to others should be made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with infectious diseases specialists and/or public health authorities, after review of available information (e.g., medical history, time from initial positive test, RT-PCR Ct values, and presence of COVID-19 signs or symptoms).Note: Serologic testing should not be used to establish the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or reinfection.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"If an infected person has clinically recovered and then later is identified as a contact of another person with COVID-19, do they need to be quarantined?","If a person has clinically recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection and is then identified as a contact of a new case 3 months or more after the date of symptom onset of their previous illness episode (or date of positive viral diagnostic test [RT-PCR or antigen test] if the person never experienced symptoms), then they should follow general quarantine recommendations for contacts and undergo repeat viral diagnostic testing.The following applies to a person who has clinically recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection that was confirmed with a viral diagnostic test and then, within 3 months since the date of symptom onset of the previous illness episode (or date of positive viral diagnostic test if the person never experienced symptoms), is identified as a contact of a new case. If the person remains asymptomatic since the new exposure, then they do not need to be retested for SARS-CoV-2 and do not need to be quarantined. However, if the person experiences new symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and an evaluation fails to identify a diagnosis other than SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., influenza), then repeat viral diagnostic testing may be warranted, in consultation with an infectious disease specialist and public health authorities for isolation guidance.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"If an infected person has clinically recovered using the symptom-based strategy, do they need a test to show they are not infectious?",No. The symptom-based strategyis intended to replace the need for repeated testing.,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"If an infected person has clinically recovered, should the person continue to wear a cloth face covering in public?","Yes. It is recommended that all persons, with a few exceptions, wearcloth face coveringsin public.1 The primary purpose of cloth face coverings is to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected persons who may be infectious but do not have clinical symptoms of illness or may have early or mild symptoms that they do not recognize. Cloth face coverings may provide reassurance to others in public settings and be a reminder of the need to maintain social distancing. However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.[1] Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
What should I do if I suspect a potential case of reinfection?,"Although current understanding of reinfection remains limited, CDC is working with its partners to characterize the clinical features, transmissibility, and immunological profile around reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the guidance remains the same to reinfections as to primary infection with SARS-CoV-2. To further our shared understanding of reinfection, CDC has released the Investigative Criteria for Suspected Cases of SARS-CoV-2 Reinfection as well as the Common Investigation Protocol for Investigating Suspected SARS-CoV-2 Reinfection. This protocol is to support public health investigations conducted by interested institutions and jurisdictions. Clinicians with available specimens for suspected cases of reinfection meeting the above investigative criteria are also invited to contact CDC at eocevent461@cdc.gov after consulting with their local health department to pursue investigations with CDC support.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Does CDC recommend use of facemasks or respirators for healthcare personnel (healthcare providers) caring for pregnant patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection?,"When available, respirators (or facemasks if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and gowns should be used for the care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection, including women who are pregnant. For more information, please see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
How should the use of N95 respirators be prioritized within obstetric healthcare settings during shortages?,"During respirator shortages, care should be taken to ensure that N95 respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. In such shortage situations, facemasks might be used for other types of patient care.Alternatives to N95 respirators might be considered where feasible. These include other classes of NIOSH-approved filtering facepiece respirators, half facepiece or full facepiece elastomeric respirators, and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. All of these alternatives will provide equivalent or higher protection than N95 respirators when properly worn. However, PAPRs and elastomeric respirators should not be used in surgical settings due to concerns that exhaled air may contaminate the sterile field. For more information please see: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators: Conventional Capacity Strategies.When respirator supplies are restored, the facility can switch back to use of N95 respirators for all care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Is forceful exhalation during the second stage of labor considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages?,"Based on limited data, forceful exhalation during the second stage of labor would not be expected to generate aerosols to the same extent as procedures more commonly considered to be aerosol generating (such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and open suctioning. Forceful exhalation during the second stage of labor is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages over procedures more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols.When respirator supplies are restored, as with all clinical care activities for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, healthcare providers should use respirators (or facemasks if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and gowns during the second stage of labor, in addition to other personal protective equipment that may be typically indicated for labor and delivery. ",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Is use of high-flow oxygen considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages?,"Based on limited data, high-flow oxygen use is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages over procedures more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols (such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and open suctioning). Patients with known or suspected COVID-19 should receive any interventions they would normally receive as standard of care. When respirator supplies are restored, as with all clinical care activities for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, respirators (or facemasks if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and gowns should be used by healthcare providers for the care of pregnant patients with known or suspected COVID-19. ",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Should intrapartum fever be considered as a possible sign of COVID-19 infection?,"Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptomscompatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Fever is the most commonly reported sign; most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed feverand/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (cough, difficulty breathing).Data regarding COVID-19 in pregnancy are limited; according to current information, presenting signs and symptoms are expected to be similar to those for non-pregnant patients, including the presence of fever.Other considerations that may guide testing are epidemiologic factors such as the occurrence of local community transmission of COVID-19 infections. As part of evaluation, clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness and peripartum fever.

What guidance is available for labor and delivery healthcare providers with potential exposure in a healthcare setting to patients with COVID-19 infection?,"healthcare providers in labor and delivery healthcare settings should follow the same infection prevention and control recommendations and personal protective equipment recommendations as all other healthcare providers. If healthcare providers are exposed to patients with COVID-19 infection, guidance is available for healthcare providers and healthcare facilities on steps to take. ",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Are empiric antibiotics recommended for patients suspected of having COVID-19?,"Several patients with COVID-19 have been reported to present with concurrent community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Decisions to administer antibiotics to COVID-19 patients should be based on the likelihood of bacterial infection (community-acquired or hospital-acquired), illness severity, and antimicrobial stewardship issues.

Do nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) worsen the course of disease for people with COVID-19?,"CDC is currently not aware of scientific evidence establishing a link between NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) and worsening of COVIDÃ¢â¬â19. FDA, the European Medicines Agency, the World Health Organization, and CDC are continuing to monitor the situation and will review new information on the effects of NSAIDs and COVID-19 disease as it becomes available. For those who wish to use treatment options other than NSAIDs, there are other over-the-counter and prescription medications approved for pain relief and fever reduction. Patients who rely on NSAIDs to treat chronic conditions and have additional questions should speak to their healthcare provider for individualized management. Patients should use NSAIDs, and all medications, according to the product labels and advice of their healthcare professional.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"If I have patients with asthma, do I need to make any changes to their daily asthma preventive management regimens to reduce their risk of getting sick with COVID-19?","People with moderate to severe asthma, particularly if not well controlled, might be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.Based on what we currently know about COVID-19, the selection of therapeutic options through guideline-recommended treatment of asthma has not been affected. National asthma guidelines are available. Continuation of inhaled corticosteroids is particularly important for patients already using these medications because there is no evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity with use of inhaled corticosteroids and an abundance of data showing reduced risk of asthma exacerbation with maintenance of asthma controller therapy.Patients with asthma but without symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19 should continue any required nebulizer treatments.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"If my patient experiences an asthma exacerbation, should the exacerbation be treated any differently to reduce risk of COVID-19?","Selection of therapeutic options through guideline-recommended treatment of asthma exacerbations has not been affected by what we currently know about COVID-19.Systemic corticosteroids should be used to treat an asthma exacerbation per national asthma guidelines and current standards of care, even if it is caused by COVID-19. Short-term use of systemic corticosteroids to treat asthma exacerbations should be continued. There is currently no evidence to suggest that short-term use of systemic corticosteroids to treat asthma exacerbations increases the risk of developing severe COVID-19, whereas there is an abundance of data to support use of systemic steroids for moderate or severe asthma exacerbations.Patients with asthma but without symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19 should continue any required nebulizer for treatments, as recommended by national professional organizations, including the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI). If healthcare providers need to be present during nebulizer use among patients who have either symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19, use CDC's recommended precautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs).Clinicians may be concerned that an asthma exacerbation is related to an underlying infection with COVID-19. Clinicians can access laboratory testing for COVID-19 through a network of state and local public health laboratories across the country. Lists of states and territories with laboratories that are using COVID-19 viral tests are available. For more information, see Testing in U.S. Clinicians should direct testing questions to their state and local health departments.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Are any changes recommended to the asthma treatment plan if my patient with asthma has COVID-19?,"Patients can be referred to CDC's recommendations for caring for themselves or someone else at home sick with COVID-19.If nebulizer use at home is necessary for patients with asthma who have symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19, use of the nebulizer in a location that minimizes and preferably avoids exposure to any other members of the household, and preferably a location where air is not recirculated into the home (like a porch, patio, or garage) is recommended by national professional organizations, including the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) by the ACAAI and the Allergy & Asthma Network (AAN). Limiting the number of people in the room or location where the nebulizer is used is also recommended by the Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA). Nebulizers should be used and cleaned according to the manufacturer's instructions.If nebulizer use in a healthcare setting is necessary for patients who have either symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19, use CDC's recommended precautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs).",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Should people with COVID-19 and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) be tested for viral hepatitis?,"Yes, for your patients with COVID-19 who have risk factors for viral hepatitis and elevated hepatic enzymes, consider testing them for hepatitis A, B, and C, virus infections. However, ALT or AST may also be associated with COVID-19 alone and indicate greater severity of illness. ",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, should high-risk populations continue to be vaccinated for hepatitis A in response to the ongoing hepatitis A outbreaks?","Yes. People who are unvaccinated and at higher risk for hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection during the widespread outbreaks of hepatitis A across the United Statesshould receive the hepatitis A vaccine when possible. This includes:people who use drugs (injection or non-injection)people experiencing unstable housing or homelessnessmen who have sex with men (MSM)people who are or were recently incarceratedpeople with chronic liver disease (including cirrhosis, hepatitis B or C) and living or working in areas where the hepatitis A outbreaks are ongoingVaccination in group settings such as jails, other correctional facilities, and homeless shelters should continue if already planned and organized in a way that would follow infection control practices and where relevant social distancing standards can be maintained. When vaccinating people in non-group settings, ensure that general practices for the safe delivery of vaccination servicesare followed. Whenever possible, vaccination efforts in non-group settings should continue for people at highest risk of acquiring HAV infection or developing serious complications from HAV infection, if staying at least 6 feet away from others can be maintained.Note: For people receiving COVID-19 vaccination, a minimum interval of 14 days is recommendedbefore or after receiving COVID-19 vaccination and any other vaccination. However, mRNA COVID-19 and other vaccines may be administered within a shorter period in situations where the benefits of vaccination are deemed to outweigh the potential unknown risks of vaccine coadministration, such as hepatitis A vaccination during an outbreak.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021

Management should continue to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B.Interim guidance to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus: Pediatric Care of HBV-exposed InfantsMake every effort to ensure HBV-exposed infants complete the hepatitis B vaccine series following the ACIP recommendations. Providers using single-component vaccine who are experiencing immunization service disruption should administer hepatitis B vaccine as close to the recommended intervals as possible, including series completion at 6 months, and follow ACIP recommendations for post-vaccination serologic testing.If post-vaccination serologic testing is delayed beyond 6 months after the hepatitis B series is completed, consider administering a booster dose of single antigen hepatitis B vaccine and then ordering post-vaccination serologic testing (HBsAg & antibody to HBsAg [anti-HBs]) 1-2 months after the booster dose.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Should hepatitis A and B vaccines continue to be administered to adults at risk for hepatitis A or B?,"Yes. Continue to administer these vaccines if an in-person visit must be scheduled or occurs for some other purpose and the clinical preventive service can be delivered during that visit with no additional risk; or an individual patient and their clinician believe that there is a compelling need to receive the service based on an assessment that the potential benefit outweighs the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The vaccination status of all patients should be assessed at every clinical encounter to reduce missed opportunities for vaccination. See the Interim Guidance for Routine and Influenza Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic for more information.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Are patients with hypertension at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19?,"Many patients with severe illness from COVID-19 have underlying hypertension.1 Hypertension is common in the United States. Hypertension is more frequent with advancing age and among non-Hispanic blacks and people with other underlying medical conditions such as obesity and diabetes. At this time, people whose only underlying medical condition is hypertension might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Should angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) be stopped in patients with COVID-19?,"No. The American Heart Association, the Heart Failure Society of America, and the American College of Cardiology recommend continuing ACE-I or ARB medications for all patients already prescribed those medications for indications such as heart failure, hypertension, or ischemic heart disease. At this time, available evidence demonstrates no indication of COVID-specific harm from these agents. Several randomized controlled trials are under way to better answer this important clinical question. Cardiovascular disease patients diagnosed with COVID-19 should be fully evaluated by a healthcare professional before adding or removing any treatments, and any changes to their treatment should be based on the latest scientific evidence. Patients who rely on ACE-Is or ARBs to treat chronic conditions and have additional questions should speak to their healthcare provider for individualized management.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
How are environmental surfaces involved in the transmission of infections?,"Surfaces can become contaminated with microorganisms and potential pathogens. However, many of these surfaces are generally not directly associated with transmission of infections to either healthcare workers or patients. The transfer of pathogens from environmental surfaces is largely due to hand contact with the surface (e.g., frequently touched surfaces). Touch contamination may lead to cross contamination of patient care items, other environmental surfaces, self-contamination, and possible infection after touching one's face or mouth.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
How does one interrupt transmission of pathogens from environmental surfaces?,Both hand hygiene and the cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces are fundamental practices to reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infections.,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
Why is cleaning of surfaces important?,"Cleaning is an important first step for any process that involves disinfection or sterilization because the presence of organic and inorganic soils may cause disinfection or sterilization to fail. Cleaning is the process of removing both organic and inorganic matter from surfaces with the use of detergents (e.g., anionic, cationic, non-ionic, and zwitter ionic) or enzymatic cleaners. Cleaning may involve manual, automated, or a combination of manual and automated methods.Depending on the cleaning method and the surface being cleaned, a 102-106 log reduction of microorganisms may be possible.Proper cleaning may be enough to make an environmental surface safe to handle and to prevent transmission of pathogens.Currently, no cleaning guidelines apply to all devices or surfaces, nor is there a single accepted standard method to measure the effectiveness of cleaning (examples include adenosine triphosphate (ATP), fluorescent markers, blood, protein, carbohydrate, RODACTM plates, or touch plates).See the CDC Environmental Toolkitfor additional information on developing a cleaning evaluation program.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
What detergents are used for routine environmental cleaning in healthcare settings?,"Many cleaners used in healthcare settings for routine cleaning of the general environment are cationic detergents, with many of these being quaternary ammonium compounds which are also low- to intermediate-level disinfectants. For EPA registered detergent disinfectants, refer to the label to determine if the product is a one-step or multiple-step product, and follow the product label instructions for use.One-step disinfection product and process combine cleaning and disinfection of a noncritical environmental surface or item into a single step. Depending on the instructions for product use, some do not have to be rinsed off.Multi-step products and processes require the user to clean the surface before it is disinfected. In some cases, the disinfectant must be rinsed from the surface following the wet contact time listed on the product label.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),https://www.cdc.gov,3/30/2021
How do vaccines differ?,"Vaccines differ in their composition and how they trigger the immune response to create antibodies.

What happens if an adverse event is reported?,"As with any vaccine, it is essential to closely monitor the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines as they are delivered. If a problem is reported following vaccination, a thorough investigation should take place. During these investigations, it is extremely rare that health problems are found to be caused by the vaccine itself. Adverse events are most often found to be coincidental and may be entirely unrelated to vaccination. Sometimes they are related to how the vaccine has been stored, transported, or administered. Such errors can be prevented by better training health workers and strengthening supply chains. In the very rare cases where a genuine adverse reaction is suspected, the vaccine may be suspended from use. Further investigations will take place to determine what exactly caused the event, and corrective measures will be put in place. WHO works with vaccine manufacturers, health officials and other partners to monitor any safety concerns and potential side effects on an ongoing basis.",World Health Organization,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety,3/29/2021

"As safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 are approved, who should be the first to receive them?","WHO believes that everyone, everywhere who could benefit from safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines should have access as quickly as possible, starting with those at highest risk of serious disease or death. WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has released two key documents to help guide the allocation and prioritization of populations to receive COVID-19 vaccines: The Values Framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination, which offers high-level guidance globally on the values and ethical considerations regarding allocation of COVID-19 vaccines between countries, and offers guidance nationally on the prioritization of groups for vaccination within countries while supply is limited. The Roadmap for Prioritizing Population Groups for Vaccines against COVID-19, which recommends public health strategies and target priority groups for different levels of vaccine availability and epidemiologic settings. Examples of target priority groups include frontline health and care workers at high risk of infection, older adults, and those people at high risk of death because of underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes.In addition, WHO led the development of a Fair Allocation Framework that aims to ensure that successful COVID-19 vaccines and treatments are shared equitably across all countries. This framework a key part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.The framework advises that as safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are authorized for use, all countries should receive doses in proportion to their population size to immunize the highest-priority groups. In the second phase, vaccines would continue to be deployed to all countries so that additional populations can be covered according to national priorities.",World Health Organization,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety,3/29/2021
What is WHO doing to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines will be allocated fairly?,"WHO is one of the leaders of a global alliance known as COVAX, the vaccine pillar of the ACT-Accelerator collaboration, which is working to accelerate the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and ensure that there is fair and equitable access to these vaccines for all countries.COVAX will allocate vaccines across countries according to a framework developed by a group that includes ethicists, scientists, and other health experts and vetted by WHOs Member States. Under this framework, COVID-19 vaccines will be rolled out in two phases. In the first phase, they will be allocated according to population size to all participating countries at the same time, so as to protect those people at greatest risk of infection and of severe disease.WHOs Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has provided recommendations about which populations should be prioritized first. These include frontline health and care workers at high risk of infection, older adults, and those people at high risk of death because of underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes. In the second phase of the roll-out, as more doses are produced, vaccines can go to groups less at risk of being infected or of suffering badly.COVAX aims to provide at least 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021. The Facility has achieved that goal and additionally has the possibility to increase those doses by another 1 billion as right of first refusal for several candidates in clinical trials supported by CEPI. Although these doses are not enough for everyone in all countries, it may be enough to end the acute stage of the crisis and put the world on the road to ending the pandemic.",World Health Organization,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety,3/29/2021
How is WHO helping countries prepare for COVID-19 vaccines?,"Along with accelerating COVID-19 vaccine research and helping scale up manufacturing capacity, WHO is working in close partnership with countries, regional colleagues, and other partners to develop needed policies, strengthen regulatory capacity, training courses, and guide countries in all the needed preparations for a programme to deliver COVID-19 vaccines. WHO, UNICEF, and partners are supporting countries in preparing for COVID-19 vaccine introduction.TheCountryReadiness and Delivery workstream which is part of the ACT Accelerator hasdeveloped atoolboxwithguidance, tools, and trainings.For example, WHOs Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has issued interim policy recommendations for the rollout of the first COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. These recommendations can guide and support country decision-making bodies, such as the National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups, on the optimal use of existing COVID-19 vaccines. SAGE is expected to review other vaccines in the coming months.WHO has also developed detailed technical guidance and adaptable planning tools and templates to help countries plan for COVID-19 vaccines considering the many aspects of readiness that need to be put in place. These areas include planning and implementation, data and monitoring, supply and logistics, and acceptance and demand. To support initial preparations, a vaccine introduction readiness assessment tool (VIRAT) has been developed and disseminated. It provides countries with an integrated roadmap of milestones and a framework for self-monitoring progress in preparing for vaccine introduction. This will help ensure that COVID-19 vaccines reach those in need as soon as they are available.WHO advises every country to develop a National Deployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP) for COVID-19 vaccines. Having one plan in each country, that comprehensively describes all elements of the countrys approach to COVID-19 vaccine rollout will be crucial for a coordinated effort.Guidance on developing that planis available from WHO, including all elements that a country needs to consider.",World Health Organization,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety,3/29/2021

Some COVID-19 vaccine candidates have completed their phase III trials, andmany other potential vaccines are being developed.Independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence is required for each vaccine candidate, including regulatory review and approval in the country where the vaccine is manufactured, before WHO considers a vaccine candidate forprequalification. Part of this process also involves theGlobal Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety. In addition to review of the data for regulatory purposes, the evidence must also be reviewed for the purpose of policy recommendations on how the vaccines should be used.An external panel of expertsconvened by WHO, called the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), analyzes the results from clinical trials, along with evidence on the disease, age groups affected, risk factors for disease, programmatic use, and other information. SAGE then recommends whether and how the vaccines should be used. Officials in individual countries decide whether to approve the vaccines for national use and develop policies for how to use the vaccines in their country based on the WHO recommendations. The vaccines must be manufactured in large quantities, which is a major and unprecedented challenge all the while continuing to produce all the other important life-saving vaccines already in use. As a final step, all approved vaccines will require distribution through a complex logistical process, with rigorous stock management and temperature control.WHO is working with partners aroundthe world to accelerate every step of this process, while also ensuring the highest safety standards are met.

Who should be excluded from receiving COVID-19 vaccines?,"Medical professionals can best advise individuals on whether or not they should receive a COVID-19 vaccine. However, based on available evidence, people with the following health conditions should generally be excluded from COVID-19 vaccination in order to avoid possible adverse effects: If you have a history of severe allergic reactions to any ingredients of the COVID-19 vaccine. If you are currently sick or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, though you can get vaccinated once your primary symptoms have resolved. Further research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of different COVID-19 vaccines in certain population groups. In addition to the general recommendations above, each vaccine may have specific considerations for specific populations and health conditions.",World Health Organization,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety,3/29/2021

What if I do not want to get vaccinated?,"Vaccination is not mandatory. But the government highly encourages the public to get vaccinated and be protected against preventable disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has taken many lives, and continues to put many at risk. It has also disrupted the economy, leaving many Filipinos jobless or underemployed. With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines which can (1) prevent symptomatic infection and possibly (2) prevent severe infection and (3) prevent transmission, we have the opportunity to get ahead of the virus. However, like many vaccines being used in the past decades, the protective effect on our community is maximized only when at least 70% of the population get vaccinated. For example, if your barangay has 100,000 people, at least 70,000 should be vaccinated to ensure protection of the community. So remember, this is not just about getting you or your family vaccinated, this is about getting your barangay, city, province up for it.",Philippine Department of Health (DOH),https://doh.gov.ph/COVID-19/FAQs,3/31/2021

Is information available about serious adverse events?,"The available safety data to support the EUA include 37,586 of the participants enrolled in an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants. These participants, 18,801 of whom received the vaccine and 18,785 of whom received saline placebo, were followed for a median of 2 months after receiving the 2nd dose. This is consistent with the recommendations set forth in FDA's October 2020 Guidance on Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19.The most commonly reported side effects were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. Side effects typically started within two days of vaccination and resolved 1-2 day later. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose.FDA also evaluated additional safety data from the larger database that included participants enrolled later during the study who had shorter follow-up (the total database included 43,448 participants, 21,720 of whom received vaccine and 21,728 of whom received saline placebo) .

Are vaccine providers required to report side effects?,"Serious adverse events, while uncommon (<1.0%), were observed at slightly higher numerical rates in the vaccine study group compared to the saline placebo study group, both overall and for certain specific adverse events occurring in very small numbers. These represented common medical events that occur in the general population at similar frequency. Upon further review by FDA, these imbalances do not raise a safety concern, nor do they suggest a causal relationship to vaccination for the vast majority of reported serious adverse events.Serious adverse events considered by FDA to be plausibly related to the vaccine or vaccination procedure were one case of shoulder injury at the vaccination site and one case of swollen lymph node in the armpit opposite the vaccination arm.No safety concerns were identified in subgroup analyses by age, race, ethnicity, medical comorbidities, or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine during mass vaccination outside of the clinical trial setting.

Can the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine cause infertility in women?,"The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine. The vaccine contains a synthetic, small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic material (mRNA) that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive ""spike""protein. When vaccinated, the body produces copies of the spike protein, which alone does not cause disease, and the immune system learns to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.Although this technology has not been used in any FDA-licensed preventive vaccine, FDA scientists have expertise with this technology as it has been used to develop other preventive investigational vaccines that have been tested in human clinical trials. FDA does not have specific safety concerns with a vaccine that utilizes this technology.",Food and Drug Administration,https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-frequently-asked-questions,3/31/2021
What materials about the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is FDA making available to vaccine providers and vaccine recipients?,"There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the vaccine could cause infertility in women. In addition, infertility is not known to occur as a result of natural COVID-19 disease, further demonstrating that immune responses to the virus, whether induced by infection or a vaccine, are not a cause of infertility. Reports on social media have falsely asserted that the vaccine could cause infertility in women and the FDA is concerned that this misinformation may cause women to avoid vaccination to prevent COVID-19, which is a potentially serious and life-threatening disease. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 vary and are unpredictable; many people have no symptoms or only mild disease, while some have severe respiratory disease including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to multi-organ failure and death. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is a mRNA vaccine. It contains a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus's genetic material that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive Ã¢â¬ÅspikeÃ¢â¬Â protein. After a person is vaccinated, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, and triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Contrary to false reports on social media, this protein is not the same as any involved in formation of the placenta.",Food and Drug Administration,https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-frequently-asked-questions,3/31/2021
How will additional data on the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine be obtained?,"The company has submitted a pharmacovigilance plan to FDA to monitor the safety of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The pharmacovigilance plan includes a plan to complete longer-term safety follow-up for participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. The pharmacovigilance plan also includes other activities aimed at monitoring the safety profile of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and ensuring that any safety concerns are identified and evaluated in a timely manner.Responsibility for additional post-authorization vaccine safety monitoring will be shared primarily by FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with other agencies involved in healthcare delivery. Post-authorization safety monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic vaccination program will aim to continuously monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines to rapidly detect safety problems if they exist. There will be multiple, complementary systems in place with validated analytic methods that can rapidly detect signals for possible vaccine safety problems. The U.S. government has a well-established post-authorization/post-approval vaccine safety monitoring infrastructure that will be scaled up to meet the needs of a large-scale COVID-19 vaccination program. The U.S. government Ã¢â¬â in partnership with health systems, academic centers, and private sector partners Ã¢â¬â will use multiple existing vaccine safety monitoring systems to monitor COVID-19 vaccines in the post-authorization/approval period.

Who made the decision to authorize the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for emergency use?,"FDA believes it is feasible to conduct placebo-controlled trials of COVID-19 vaccines after another vaccine is made available under an EUA, especially if that vaccine is not available in sufficient quantity for everyone who wants to receive it. Additionally, it may be feasible to conduct trials where safety and effectiveness of one or more COVID-19 vaccines are evaluated against a comparator COVID-19 vaccine that has been authorized for use under an EUA.",Food and Drug Administration,https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-frequently-asked-questions,3/31/2021
How are you going to educate the public about the safety and effectiveness of the the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine?,"FDA's career scientists and physicians in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research made a determination that the emergency use authorization request met the criteria for issuing an EUA. Our Chief Scientist, RADM Denise Hinton, signed the authorization.",Food and Drug Administration,https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-frequently-asked-questions,3/31/2021
What other changes or updates were made to the letter of authorization for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine?,"FDA previously advised that it is acceptable to use every full dose obtainable from each vial (the sixth, or possibly even a seventh), pending resolution of the issue of how many full doses are obtainable per vial of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.Ã¢â¬Â¯FDA also advised that any further product remaining that does not constitute a full dose should not be pooled from multiple vials to create one.Pfizer has submitted requests to FDA for the EUA to clarify the number of doses obtainable per vial of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. In order to provide flexibility to vaccine providers, FDA updated the Letter of Authorization for the EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to remove reference to the number of doses contained in one vial after dilution. The Agency also updated the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) to note that, after dilution, one vial of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contains six doses of 0.3 mL. This updated Fact Sheet for Vaccination Providers also notes that low dead-volume syringes and/or needles can be used to extract six doses from a single vial. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial.Given that the original Letter of Authorization noted that each vial contained 5 doses, we recognize that some vial labels and cartons may state that after dilution, a vial contains 5 doses of 0.3 mL. The information in the Fact Sheet regarding the number of doses per vial after dilution supersedes the number of doses stated on vial labels and cartons.Because the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine does not contain preservative, it is critical to note that any further remaining product that does not constitute a full dose should not be pooled from multiple vials to create one dose. The updated information in the revised Fact Sheet for Vaccination Providers should address any questions or confusion about whether these additional full doses may be used.",Food and Drug Administration,https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-frequently-asked-questions,3/31/2021
The reissued LOA also mentions that changes pertaining to safety monitoring were made to the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine Vaccination Providersand the Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers. What were these changes?,The reissued LOA includes updated language (found at letter Ã¢â¬ÅTÃ¢â¬Â of the LOA) to clarify the instructions for reporting adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).,Food and Drug Administration,https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-frequently-asked-questions,3/31/2021
Why did FDA revise and issue a new LOA when the agency already posted information about the potential for extra doses in the vials?,"The Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) was updated to include in the Warnings section reference to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for monitoring Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions. This is in addition to the warning that appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Severe allergic reactions have been reported following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine during mass vaccination outside of the clinical trial setting.The Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) was also updated to instruct vaccination providers to provide information about v-safe to vaccine recipients. V-safe is a new voluntary smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to check in with people who have been vaccinated to identify potential side effects after COVID-19 vaccination.The original Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers informed vaccine recipients about a remote chance that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction soon after vaccination. The Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers was updated to inform vaccine recipients that because of the possibility of allergic reactions, their vaccination provider may ask them to stay at the place where they received their vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. The Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers was also updated to provide information on v-safe.",Food and Drug Administration,https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-frequently-asked-questions,3/31/2021

Your health history will be crucial in determining whether you should get vaccinated or what vaccines are appropriate for you. It is therefore important that you take the health screening seriously.

Show up on the day of your screening and declare your complete medical history (e.g. allergies, risky behavior). The health care professional will only be able to assess you correctly if you provide the correct information. If you did not undergo screening, you will not be booked or scheduled for vaccination.",Philippine Department of Health (DOH),https://doh.gov.ph/taxonomy/term/9804,4/1/2021
What to do on the day of vaccination?,"a.  Go to your assigned vaccination site on time - of course wearing your mask and face shield.
b.  Before getting your shot, you will sign an informed consent form signifying your willingness to be vaccinated and that you are aware of the benefits and risks of the vaccine.

Follow the minimum health standards protocols in your vaccination site to keep everyone safe (e.g. physical distancing appropriately).

c.  Immediately after being vaccinated, you will receive your vaccination card and you will be asked to stay in the facility for 1 hour before you can go home. This is to allow your health care providers to monitor if you will experience any unusual symptoms, or what we call adverse events.  Because we take safety seriously, monitoring will continue for until 12 months after you get your shot.",Philippine Department of Health (DOH),https://doh.gov.ph/taxonomy/term/9804,4/1/2021
What to do after vaccination?,"You may experience some side effects, similar to having the flu but this should go away in a few days. Donât worry, this is a normal sign that your body is building protection. In most cases, discomfort from fever or pain is normal but do contact your health care provider if the redness or tenderness where you got the shot increases after 24 hours or if your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days.

It is important that you report to the health authorities so experts can study whether the adverse event was indeed a result of vaccination or a mere coincidence. We donât want to worry the public unnecessarily.

Also, with most COVID-19 vaccines, you will need 2 shots in order for you to get the promised protection. Get the second shot even if you have side effects after the first shot, unless your healthcare provider tells you not to get a second shot.",Philippine Department of Health (DOH),https://doh.gov.ph/taxonomy/term/9804,4/1/2021
How to continuously protect me and my family?,"Since it takes time for your body to build protection after any vaccination, you are only protected until a week or two after your second shot.  Even then, vaccines are just one of the many tools for us to stop the pandemic.

With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines which can (1) prevent symptomatic infection and possibly (2) prevent severe infection and (3) prevent transmission, we have the opportunity to get ahead of the virus.

However, like many vaccines being used in the past decades, the protective effect on our community is maximized only when at least 70% of the population get vaccinated.

For example, if your barangay has 100,000 people, at least 70,000 should be vaccinated to ensure protection of the community.

Phase 1: The candidate  vaccine is given to a small number (10-100) of healthy adults with the primary aim of assessing safety
Phase 2: If the candidate vaccine is found safe in Phase 1, it will be given to 100-1000 participants to determine how effectively it stimulates immune response and if there are any side effects
Phase 3: If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective in Phase 2, it will be given to thousands of people (as much as ~30K) to determine if it protects a large population from the disease and whether there are any uncommon or serious side effects.

Even for vaccines that will eventually be given approval, monitoring of people who are vaccinated will still be done as there are very rare (i.e. 1 in 100,000 or 1 in 500,000 people) side effects that large clinical trials may not capture or the clinical trials may not have included groups who may have higher risk of side effects than those who participated in the trials (e.g. pregnant women, older population).",Philippine Department of Health (DOH),https://doh.gov.ph/taxonomy/term/9972,4/2/2021

Most reactions to vaccines are mild and go away within a few days on their own. More serious or long-lasting side effects to vaccines are possible but extremely rare. Vaccines are continually monitored to detect rare adverse events. Reported side effects to COVID-19 vaccines have mostly been mild to moderate and short-lasting. They include: fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, diarrhoea, and pain at the injection site. The chances of any of these side effects following vaccination differ according to the specific COVID-19 vaccine.",World Health Organization,https://doh.gov.ph/node/28471,3/31/2021
Can I stop wearing a mask after?,"Since it takes time for your body to build protection after any vaccination, you are only protected until a week or two after your second shot.  Even then, vaccines are just one of the many tools for us to stop the pandemic.

We all need to continue wearing masks, staying at least 1 meter away from others, avoiding crowds, and washing hands often to protect yourself and your family.",Philippine Department of Health (DOH),https://doh.gov.ph/node/28000,4/2/2021
What do I do on the day of the vaccination?,"a.  Go to your assigned vaccination site on time - of course wearing your mask and face shield.
b.  Before getting your shot, you will sign an informed consent form signifying your willingness to be vaccinated and that you are aware of the benefits and risks of the vaccine.

Follow the minimum health standards protocols in your vaccination site to keep everyone safe (e.g. physical distancing appropriately).

c.  Immediately after being vaccinated, you will receive your vaccination card and you will be asked to stay in the facility for 1 hour before you can go home. This is to allow your health care providers to monitor if you will experience any unusual symptoms, or what we call adverse events.  Because we take safety seriously, monitoring will continue for until 12 months after you get your shot.",Philippine Department of Health (DOH),https://doh.gov.ph/node/28471,4/1/2021

Even if you have already recovered from COVID-19, it is possibleâalthough rareâthat you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 again. If you were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html,4/2/2021

Do I need to social distance after vaccine?,"Since it takes time for your body to build protection after any vaccination, you are only protected until a week or two after your second shot.  Even then, vaccines are just one of the many tools for us to stop the pandemic.

We all need to continue wearing masks, staying at least 1 meter away from others, avoiding crowds, and washing hands often to protect yourself and your family.",Philippine Department of Health (DOH),https://doh.gov.ph/node/28471,4/2/2021

What is efficacy?,"WHO defines efficacy as reduction in disease incidence in a vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated group under optimal conditions such as in a randomized clinical trial.

For COVID-19 vaccine trials, the primary endpoint  is the occurrence of symptomatic COVID-19 but they are also measuring other endpoints such as severe COVID, hospitalization due to COVID.",Philippine Department of Health (DOH),"

Does the vaccine completely prevent an individual from getting and transmitting COVID-19?,"No vaccine provides 100% protection from COVID-19. It typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity after vaccination. That means it is possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and still get sick because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection.

In addition, efficacy is measured not only by a vaccine's ability to prevent infection, but also in its prevention of severe forms of the disease and of forward transmission. While a vaccinated person  may not be completely prevented from getting infected, s/he will still have a reduced risk of getting severe forms of COVID-19. If more people have this reduced risk, then we can more effectively reduce transmission.",Philippine Department of Health (DOH),"
