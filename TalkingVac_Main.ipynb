    "2020 will go down in our modern history as the year of the COVID-19 pandemic. This infectious respiratory disease has disrupted the daily lives of billions of people around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first case of COVID-19 in the Philippines was identified on January 30, 2020 and eventually spread throughout the country prompting the government to impose lockdowns or community quarantines to limit the spread of the virus. In order for our daily lives to get back to normal, we have to reach herd immunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### But what is herd immunity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Herd immunity occurs when a large portion of a community (the herd) becomes immune to a disease, making the spread from person to person unlikely. It is vital because herd immunity protects the whole community, and not just those who are immune to the disease. Moreover, the more contagious a disease is, the greater the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to it to stop its spread. For example, measles is a highly contagious illness. It's estimated that 94% of the population must be immune to interrupt the chain of transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we achieve herd immunity for COVID-19?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two paths: vaccines and natural infection. Vaccines are the ideal approach because they create immunity without causing illness or resulting complications. Using the concept of herd immunity, vaccines have successfully controlled deadly contagious diseases such as smallpox, polio, and many others. As for natural infection, even though majority of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, some individuals develop complications and develop severe symptoms which could be deadly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this project we explore:\n",
    "1. \"What are the sentiments of the people on COVID-19 vaccination?\" through *sentiment analysis*\n",
    "2. \"What are the main concerns on COVID-19 vaccination?\" through *topic modelling*\n",
    "3. \"How do we address people’s concerns/ questions on COVID-19 vaccination?\" through building a \"Question Answering Bot\""

Next is tokenization, which is basically just getting each word from the tweet, and then applying bigrams and trigams on them. Bigrams and trigrams joins two or three words that doesn't make sense to be used alone, such as \"high school\". After that, we removed the stop words, which are the most common words such as “the”, “is”, “in”, “for”, “where”, “when”, “to”, “at”, and many more. Lastly, the tweets are lemmatized wherein the words are converted to their meaningful base forms called lemma.\n",
